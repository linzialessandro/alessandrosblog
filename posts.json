      "content": "<p>There is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the modern technical economy, and the rise of Generative AI has simply made it impossible to ignore. It is a logic loop that currently governs the lives of the world’s smartest engineers.</p><p>Consider the daily reality of a researcher at a frontier AI lab. They wake up early. They drink coffee. They exert themselves tremendously. They embrace the stress of creation, the “grind” of engineering, and the cognitive load of high-dimensional problem-solving. We view this exertion as virtuous. We call it self-realization.</p><p>But look at the <em>output</em> of that exertion. What are they building? They are building tools designed to eliminate exertion. They are working stressfully to create a world where stress does not exist.</p><h2>The Paradox of Relief</h2><p>We are caught in a hypocritical definition of value that splits the human experience into two incompatible halves:</p><ul><li><strong>For the Builder</strong>, we value the struggle. We say their stress gives them purpose, agency, and mastery.</li><li><strong>For the User</strong>, we value the ease. We say the lack of stress gives them freedom and time.</li></ul><p>This cannot hold. If “success” is defined strictly as the removal of friction—the automated email, the generated code, the instant answer—then the Builder is actively engaged in the suicide of their own purpose. We are sacrificing our own agency to build a cage of comfort for the next generation.</p><h2>The Utilitarian Trap</h2><p>Why do we do this? Because our current philosophy of technology is purely Utilitarian. It assumes that <em>effort</em> is a cost to be minimized, and <em>output</em> is a benefit to be maximized.</p><p>Under this framework, a harsh reality emerges: if a machine can produce the output (the essay, the diagnosis, the software) with zero effort, then human effort is mathematically waste. It is heat loss in the engine.</p><p>But this ignores the existential reality of the human animal. We are not output-machines; we are process-machines. The Greeks understood this distinction better than we do. They distinguished between <em>poiesis</em> (making something for the sake of the product) and <em>praxis</em> (doing something for the sake of the activity itself).</p><p>AI is the ultimate engine of <em>poiesis</em>. It gives us the product without the process. But if we outsource the process, we lose the <em>praxis</em>—the internal change that occurs within us when we overcome resistance.</p><h2>The Prophecy of 1983</h2><p>This is not just philosophy; it is rigorous psychology. In 1983, Lisanne Bainbridge published <strong>“Ironies of Automation,”</strong> a paper that effectively predicted the crisis of agency we face today.</p><p>Bainbridge’s central irony was that by automating the routine parts of a task to “reduce error,” we actually make the human operator more prone to catastrophic failure. Why? Because the human brain requires the friction of the routine to maintain the mental model of the system. </p><p>When we remove the “drudgery” of manual control, we don’t free the human; we detach them. We turn the pilot into a passenger. And passengers do not learn. Passengers do not grow. Passengers merely arrive.</p><h2>Toward a Philosophy of Voluntary Friction</h2><p>So, where do we go from here? We cannot stop the technology, nor should we. But we must rethink the foundations of why we wake up in the morning.</p><p>We must move from a philosophy of <strong>Necessity</strong> (I work because I must survive) to a philosophy of <strong>Voluntary Friction</strong>.</p><p>In a world where AI can solve the problem, the only reason to solve it yourself is because the <em>act of solving it</em> shapes who you are. We must start treating cognitive struggle the way we treat physical exercise. We don’t lift weights because we need to move iron disks from point A to point B. We move them because the resistance strengthens the muscle.</p><p>If we continue to define success as the “removal of work,” we will succeed in engineering our own obsolescence. But if we redefine success as the “freedom to choose our work,” we might just survive our own inventions.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ironies of Automation (Bainbridge, 1983)</a></p>"

The test itself measures what you know, but your score often measures how much professional coaching you could access to explain what you <em>didn't</em> know.</p><p>That gap is why Google’s collaboration with the College Board and The Princeton Review to bring Gemini into SAT practice is worth a deeper look. It attacks the scarcity of tutoring directly. While the headlines focus on the tool being “free,” that misses the point (and ignores the hardware barrier of owning a device). The real shift here isn't price; it's the move from static verification to dynamic explanation.</p><h2>Closing the feedback loop</h2><p>Learning happens in the feedback loop. In the old model of self-study, a student takes a practice test, checks the key, and sees they got Question 14 wrong. They know the correct answer is C, but they often don’t understand the underlying logic. A human tutor fixes this by spotting the misconception and walking the student through the reasoning step-by-step.</p><p>Gemini is now attempting to scale that specific interaction. It doesn't just grade the test; it offers reasoning-based feedback that breaks down the problem, clarifies the concepts, and helps the student reason their way to the correct answer without just handing it over.</p><h2>Grounding the model</h2><p>This is a high-value use case for modern LLMs because it leverages their strength in reasoning while constraining them to a ground-truth dataset. By using official questions from The Princeton Review, the system avoids the common pitfall of AI “hallucinating” poorly structured test questions. It turns the model from a creative writer into a context-aware coach that knows exactly what the test is asking.</p><p>We are seeing a transition from “tech-enabled” prep (digitizing the paper test) to “AI-native” prep (simulating the tutor). It doesn't solve every equity issue in education, but it does commoditize the kind of personalized feedback that used to cost $100 an hour.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/education/practice-sat-gemini/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Blog</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>Words shape how we think about systems. When we talk about \"safety filters\" or \"guardrails,\" we invoke the image of a machine that needs to be fenced in. When Anthropic chose the term <strong>Constitution</strong> for their alignment method, they invoked something different: the idea of governance through explicit, written principles.</p>\n\n<h2>Moving beyond the 'blocklist' mentality</h2>\n<p>Historically, making an AI safe meant training it on a massive list of bad examples and saying \"don't do this.\" This approach, often called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), relies heavily on human contractors making judgment calls on thousands of edge cases. It works, but it’s brittle. It’s hard to know <em>why</em> the model refused a prompt—was it a safety rule, a bias in the training data, or just a random contractor's preference?</p>\n\n<p>Constitutional AI flips this. Instead of inferring values from thousands of clicks, the model is given a short, readable document—its Constitution—and trained to critique and revise its own responses based on those rules. The safety behavior isn't an emergent property of a black box; it's a direct downstream effect of the text in the Constitution.</p>\n\n<h2>Why 'Constitution' is the right metaphor</h2>\n<p>The term is potent because it implies three things that traditional RLHF lacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> You can actually read the rules. Anthropic publishes the document. It draws from the UN Declaration of Human Rights, Apple’s Terms of Service, and even \"common sense\" non-western perspectives. It’s a messy, human document, but it is <em>visible</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Stability:</strong> A constitution is harder to change than a config file. It suggests a foundational layer that doesn't fluctuate with every model update or minor patch.</li>\n<li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> By explicitly citing sources like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Anthropic is acknowledging that AI values shouldn't be invented in a vacuum by engineers. They are borrowing legitimacy from established human consensus.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The mechanics of principles</h2>\n<p>The fascinating part is how this works mechanically. During training, the model generates a response, then essentially asks itself: <em>\"Does this response violate the Constitution?\"</em> If yes, it rewrites it. This \"critique and revise\" loop happens thousands of times.</p>\n\n<p>This method—<strong>Constitutional AI (CAI)</strong>—does two things. First, it scales supervision (you don't need a human to label every bad output). Second, and more importantly, it makes the model's behavior more interpretable. If the model refuses a request, you can theoretically trace that refusal back to a specific principle in the Constitution, rather than a nebulous \"safety score.\"</p>\n\n<h2>A step toward public oversight?</h2>\n<p>The most optimistic take on this framing is that it prepares the ground for public input. If safety is defined by a readable document, then we can debate the document. We can have different constitutions for different use cases. We can ask: \"Should Principle X be prioritized over Principle Y?\"</p>\n\n<p>This is a much healthier conversation than asking \"Why is the bot woke?\" or \"Why is the bot toxic?\" It moves the debate from the output level to the governance level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/constitution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic Constitution</a></p>"

Then <strong>CNNs</strong> (Convolutional Neural Networks) take over. Then the <strong>Transformer</strong> eats the world. Then come <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong>.</p><p>It feels like a zoo. We treat these architectures as distinct species, each with its own habitat, diet, and care instructions. We build them differently, train them differently, and debug them differently. But deep down, many of us have suspected that this fragmentation is artificial. Surely, intelligence doesn't require a thousand different theories?</p><p>A fascinating paper, <em>Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures</em> (ICML 2024), confirms that suspicion. It argues that if we put on the X-ray glasses of <strong>Category Theory</strong>, the zoo disappears. There is only one animal, just seen from different angles.</p><h2>Wait, what is Category Theory?</h2><p>Before you run for the hills, let’s demystify the math. Category Theory is often called “the mathematics of mathematics,” which sounds terrifyingly abstract. But for a programmer, it is actually the most intuitive math there is.</p><p>Think of it as the ultimate <strong>Design Pattern</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Objects (The Dots):</strong> In programming, these are your data types. Strings, Integers, Images.</li><li><strong>Morphisms (The Arrows):</strong> These are your functions. A function that turns an Image into a Label is an arrow from the Image object to the Label object.</li><li><strong>Composition:</strong> This is just piping. If you have an arrow from A to B, and an arrow from B to C, you automatically have a path from A to C.</li></ul><p>That’s it. That’s the core. But the magic happens when you realize that <em>relationships</em> matter more than the details. Category theory doesn’t care how you implement the function; it cares about how the function composes with others.</p><h2>The \"Grand Unification\" of AI</h2><p>So, how does this fix our AI zoo problem? The researchers—Bruno Gavranović and his team—propose a framework called <strong>Categorical Deep Learning (CDL)</strong>.</p><p>In standard Deep Learning, we focus on the specific operations: matrix multiplications, ReLUs, convolutions. In CDL, we zoom out. We look at the <em>structure</em> of the information flow.</p><p>The paper introduces a concept called <strong>Para</strong> (the category of Parametric maps). In plain English: a neural network layer is simply a function that takes some <em>parameters</em> (weights) and an <em>input</em> to produce an <em>output</em>. In the language of category theory, this isn't just a messy calculation; it's a well-behaved mathematical object called a <strong>morphism in a specific category</strong>.</p><h3>The \"Aha!\" Moment</h3><p>Here is the killer insight from the paper: <strong>Architectures are just Monads.</strong></p><p>If you’ve used Haskell (or modern React), you might know Monads as “wrappers” that handle side effects. In AI, the “side effect” is structure. The paper proves that:</p><ul><li><strong>RNNs</strong> are not random loops; they are algebras of a specific Monad that handles <em>sequentiality</em>.</li><li><strong>GNNs</strong> are not just message-passing hacks; they are algebras of a Monad that handles <em>connectivity</em>.</li><li><strong>Transformers</strong> are... well, you guessed it.</li></ul><p>This means that an RNN and a GNN are mathematically the <em>same thing</em>, just parameterized over a different geometric base. One operates on a line (time), the other on a graph (space). The equations describing how they learn are identical.</p><h2>Why this matters for the rest of us</h2><p>You might ask, “Alessandro, I just want to ship code. Why do I care about Monads?”</p><p>Because <strong>alchemy doesn't scale</strong>. Right now, we are alchemists. We mix layers and hope for gold. If we want to become chemists, we need the Periodic Table. Category Theory provides that table.</p><p>1. <strong>Transferable Intuition:</strong> Once you understand the categorical structure of an RNN, you automatically understand the deep structure of a GNN. You stop learning tools and start learning principles.</p><p>2. <strong>Correctness by Construction:</strong> Imagine a compiler that screams at you not because your tensor shapes are wrong, but because your <em>logic</em> doesn't compose. That is the promise of CDL. We can build libraries where it is mathematically impossible to create an architecture that violates the symmetries of your data.</p><p>We are moving from the era of \"making it work\" to the era of \"understanding why it works.\" And it turns out, the answer was algebra all along.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Categorical Deep Learning (arXiv)</a></p>"

You are looking for a stable configuration in a near-infinite space of possibilities. Traditional simulation is precise but slow; human intuition is fast but biased and limited by bandwidth.</p><p>The argument here is that heavy-duty models act as high-dimensional librarians.

Both Google and Perplexity have rolled out significant updates centered on “Personal Intelligence” and “Memory.” While they sound similar, they represent two divergent philosophies about where AI fits into our lives.</p><h2>Google: The “Life OS” Approach</h2><p>Google’s vision of Personal Intelligence is deeply entangled with the ecosystem they already own. With the introduction of Gems (custom versions of Gemini) and memory capabilities, they aren’t just trying to remember your chat history; they are trying to triangulate your life.</p><p>The value proposition here is <strong>integration</strong>. Because Google already holds your calendar, your emails (Gmail), your documents (Drive), and your location history (Maps), their version of memory is about connecting those dots. It’s the difference between an AI that knows <em>what</em> a flight is, and an AI that knows <em>your</em> flight is delayed and you’ll miss dinner.</p><p>This is the “Her” model of AI (minus the romance, hopefully). It aims to be a proactive layer over your personal logistics, reducing the friction of simply existing in a digital world.</p><h2>Perplexity: The Research Partner</h2><p>Perplexity’s approach to Memory is less about your personal life and more about your <strong>intellectual workflow</strong>. Their feature is designed to capture preferences and constraints: you are a developer who needs code in Rust, or a marketer who needs summaries in bullet points, or a researcher who strictly avoids non-academic sources.</p><p>This is a subtle but critical shift. Perplexity isn’t trying to be your secretary; it’s trying to be a specialized research partner that doesn’t need to be retrained every morning. It solves the frustration of “I told you this yesterday.” By layering memory over search, they are building a tool that gets faster the more you use it, not because the model gets smarter, but because the prompt engineering is increasingly automated by your own history.</p><h2>The Divergence: Living vs. Knowing</h2><p>The comparison clarifies the future landscape:</p><ul><li><strong>Google</strong> wants to minimize the friction of <strong>management</strong>. It wins if you spend less time coordinating your schedule and finding your files.</li><li><strong>Perplexity</strong> wants to minimize the friction of <strong>discovery</strong>.

In its place is something they call the “magic cycle.”</p><p>The term sounds like marketing fluff, but the mechanism is pure engineering. It describes a feedback loop where foundational research fuels products, products generate novel data at scale, and that data forces the research to tackle harder, messier problems. The result isn’t just better software; it is the industrialization of scientific discovery.</p><h2>The Quantum Bridge: From Theory to Material Reality</h2><p>For years, quantum computing has been a “someday” technology. 2025 looks like the year it became a “today” tool for specific, high-value problems. The introduction of the <strong>Willow</strong> chip and the <strong>Quantum Echoes</strong> algorithm is significant not because of qubit counts, but because of <em>verifiable utility</em>.</p><p>Running 13,000 times faster than classical supercomputers for specific simulation tasks is a metric that changes behavior. It moves us from “can we simulate this molecule?” to “let’s screen a thousand variants before lunch.” This is critical for materials science and drug discovery, where the bottleneck has always been the computational cost of simulating nature accurately. Google is effectively trying to turn chemistry into a software problem.</p><h2>Science as an Agentic Workflow</h2><p>The most profound shift in the report is the move from AI as a tool to AI as a co-scientist. We are seeing systems like the <strong>AI Co-scientist</strong> (built with DeepMind) that don’t just answer questions; they propose hypotheses, write code to test them, and interpret the results.</p><p>This pairs with <strong>WeatherNext 2</strong>, which treats weather forecasting not as a deterministic prediction but as a generative problem. By generating hundreds of physically consistent scenarios in minutes, it allows us to reason about tail risks—the “one-in-a-hundred-year” floods and fires—with a fidelity that was previously impossible. When you combine this with <strong>AlphaFold 3</strong>, the pattern is clear: the goal is to model the physical world well enough to run experiments <em>in silico</em> rather than <em>in vitro</em>.</p><h2>Escaping Earth’s Constraints: Project Suncatcher</h2><p>Perhaps the most audacious signal in the report is <strong>Project Suncatcher</strong>. It acknowledges a hard truth: scaling AI infrastructure on Earth is hitting limits—land, water, and energy are finite. Suncatcher proposes moving the compute to where the energy is: space.</p><p>The concept of solar-powered satellite constellations acting as orbital data centers sounds like science fiction, but it is a rational response to the energy density problem. If the “magic cycle” demands exponentially more compute, and the grid can’t supply it, you have to look up. It is a reminder that the constraints on AI progress are rapidly shifting from algorithmic to physical.</p><h2>The Interface is Dissolving</h2><p>On the user side, <strong>Gemini 3</strong> and the concept of <strong>Generative UI</strong> signal the end of the static application. The idea that an AI generates a custom interface—widgets, visualizations, interactive tools—on the fly creates a new paradigm. You don’t search for an app that does what you want; the system builds a micro-app for your specific intent, uses it, and then discards it.</p><p>This collapses the distance between “I have a question” and “I have a tool to solve it.” It also implies that the future of software development isn’t just writing apps, but defining the design systems that allow AI to write them for us.</p><h2>The Loop Closes</h2><p>The “magic cycle” is ultimately about velocity. When your search engine (Google) feeds your reasoning model (Gemini), which designs your chip (TPU), which runs your quantum simulation (Willow), which discovers a new material, which improves your hardware efficiency… you aren’t just competing on product features. You are competing on the speed of evolution.</p><p>Google’s 2025 isn’t just a list of launches. It is a blueprint for how a technology company attempts to become a general-purpose scientific instrument.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/accelerating-the-magic-cycle-of-research-breakthroughs-and-real-world-applications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Blog</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>For the past year, we’ve been stuck in the 'prompt-and-wait' loop. You ask a question, the AI gives an answer, and then <em>you</em> do the manual labor of copy-pasting that answer into a spreadsheet or a document. Anthropic’s new <strong>Claude Cowork</strong> research preview is designed to break that cycle. It’s an agent that doesn't just talk; it acts.</p><h2>From Conversation to Agency</h2><p>The biggest shift here is the move from a web interface to a local presence. Claude Cowork lives in a dedicated app that you grant permission to access specific folders on your hard drive. This isn't just a gimmick. Once it has file access, Claude can read your PDFs, edit your Markdown files, and even create new assets based on a messy folder of screenshots.</p><p>Early impressions from the community highlight how 'brave' the agent feels. Unlike standard chatbots that often hallucinate when tasks get complex, Cowork uses a <strong>Multi-step Planning</strong> phase. Before it touches a single file, it lays out a sequence of actions—'I will first read the CSV, then search the web for missing company data, and finally update the Notion database.' You get to see the logic before the execution starts.</p><h2>The Architecture of a Digital Assistant</h2><p>What makes this more powerful than a simple script? It’s the integration of three distinct pillars:</p><ul><li><strong>Skills & Templates:</strong> Claude comes pre-loaded with 'skills'—specialized workflows for things like data extraction, research synthesis, and content formatting. It knows the 'best practice' for these tasks without you having to prompt for it.</li><li><strong>App Connectors:</strong> It’s not limited to your local machine. Through official connectors, Cowork can reach into Slack, Google Drive, and Notion. It acts as the connective tissue between your siloed apps.</li><li><strong>A Managed Browser:</strong> If the info isn't in your files, Claude can spin up a browser instance to fetch real-time data, navigate complex UI, and bring that information back into your local workflow.</li></ul><h2>The Security Question: The Sandbox</h2><p>Granting an AI access to your computer is a terrifying prospect for many. Anthropic has addressed this by running Cowork in a <strong>hardened sandbox</strong>. The agent can only see what you explicitly show it. However, early testers have noted that while the sandbox is secure, the agent's logic isn't infallible. It can still make 'confident mistakes'—like miscategorizing a batch of files if the instructions are slightly ambiguous. The 'Human-in-the-loop' philosophy remains critical here; you aren't just a spectator, you're the supervisor.</p><h2>First Impressions: Speed vs. Capability</h2><p>The feedback from the first wave of users has been a mix of awe and patience. The latency is real; watching an agent 'think' through a 10-step plan takes longer than a standard chat response. But the payoff is the <strong>delegation of cognitive load</strong>. One researcher mentioned using Cowork to summarize 50 academic papers overnight—a task that would have taken a full workday for a human assistant. It’s not about instant answers; it’s about background progress.</p><p>We are witnessing the birth of the 'General Purpose Agent.' It’s still in the research phase—buggy, sometimes slow, and requiring a high-speed connection—but the direction is clear. The computer is finally starting to work for us, rather than us working for the computer.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic</a></p>"

The war for ecosystem lock-in is just beginning.</p><h2>The ceiling is getting crowded</h2><p>For the last few years, we picked models based on clear spikes in capability: you used one for coding, another for creative writing, and a third for logic. Reading the launch notes for both Gemini 3 and GPT-5.2, it is clear that those spikes are flattening into a high plateau.

The model isn’t just a chatbot; it is infrastructure that lives inside the document you are already writing, the email you are drafting, and the meeting video you missed. The value proposition is friction reduction: you don’t have to copy-paste context because the model already has read access to your drive.</p><p>OpenAI’s approach with GPT-5.2 feels different. It positions the model as a specialized reasoning engine—a tool you go to when you need to think through a hard problem in isolation, or an API that powers agents which act on your behalf.

      "content": "<p>Agent demos are fun, but shipping agents is a different sport. The moment an agent is allowed to take actions, you stop debugging a single output and start debugging a trajectory.</p><p>Anthropic’s <em>Demystifying evals for AI agents</em> is useful because it treats evaluation as engineering infrastructure, not as a “research benchmark.” The claim is not that evals are a nice-to-have; it’s that without evals teams get trapped in reactive loops: fix one failure in production, accidentally create three new ones, and never know whether the agent is getting better or just getting different.</p><h2>What an eval is (and what changes with agents)</h2><p>At the simplest level, an eval is: give an AI an input, then apply grading logic to measure success. In a single-turn setting, that’s already familiar: a prompt, a response, and a score.</p><p>Agents complicate this because they operate over multiple turns, call tools, and modify state. That means success is often not “did the assistant say the right thing?” but “did the environment end up in the right state?”—e.g., did the reservation actually get created in a database, did the code compile and pass tests, did the ticket really get resolved.</p><p>This framing—grading the <em>outcome</em> and sometimes also the <em>transcript</em>—is the first big conceptual shift. If the agent is doing work inside a sandbox, the only reliable truth is what changed in that sandbox.</p><h2>Vocabulary that matters in practice</h2><p>I like when a post insists on definitions, because it forces clean mental models. In Anthropic’s taxonomy:</p><ul><li>A <strong>task</strong> (test case) is one problem with inputs and success criteria.</li><li>A <strong>trial</strong> is one attempt at a task (you run multiple because outputs vary).</li><li>A <strong>grader</strong> is the scoring logic (and a task can have multiple graders).</li><li>A <strong>transcript</strong> is the full trace: messages, tool calls, intermediate results.</li><li>The <strong>outcome</strong> is the final environment state (often more important than the transcript).</li><li>An <strong>evaluation harness</strong> runs tasks end-to-end and aggregates results.</li><li>An <strong>agent harness</strong> (scaffold) is the orchestration layer that makes the model an “agent” (tool selection, loops, stopping conditions).</li></ul><p>The subtle point is that when you “evaluate an agent,” you are evaluating the harness + model as a coupled system. That’s closer to how software is actually shipped.</p><h2>Why evals compound (and why teams delay them)</h2><p>The post describes a common lifecycle: early on, teams can get far with manual testing, dogfooding, and intuition. It feels fast and it feels like progress.</p><p>The breaking point arrives later: users complain the agent got worse after a change, and the team is flying blind. Without evals, debugging becomes an incident response loop. With evals, failures become tasks, tasks become regression tests, and the whole system becomes legible.</p><p>Another pragmatic benefit is model upgrades. If a team has an eval suite, swapping the underlying model becomes less like a leap of faith and more like running a test battery, then tuning prompts/harness until the metrics recover.</p><h2>Three grader types (and why you need all three)</h2><p>Anthropic emphasizes mixing graders because each has different failure modes:</p><ul><li><strong>Code-based graders</strong>: unit tests, exact checks, static analysis, state checks. Fast, cheap, reproducible, but brittle and sometimes blind to nuance.</li><li><strong>Model-based graders</strong>: rubric scoring, comparisons, natural-language assertions. Flexible and scalable for open-ended behavior, but non-deterministic and requires calibration.</li><li><strong>Human graders</strong>: expensive and slow, but the gold standard and the calibration target for the other two.</li></ul><p>This is one of those “obvious in hindsight” points: if an agent is doing something that has crisp ground truth, use deterministic graders; if it’s doing something inherently subjective (tone, helpfulness, over-engineering), you need rubrics and humans.</p><h2>Capability evals vs regression evals</h2><p>A distinction worth stealing for any engineering org:</p><ul><li><strong>Capability</strong> evals ask: “what can this agent do?” and should start with a low pass rate. They define a hill to climb.</li><li><strong>Regression</strong> evals ask: “did we break anything?” and should aim for near-100% pass rate.</li></ul><p>As capability improves, some tasks “graduate” into regression suites. This is basically continuous integration, but for agent behavior instead of just code.</p><h2>Non-determinism: pass@k vs pass^k</h2><p>Agent systems are stochastic, so a single run is not a measurement. Anthropic highlights two metrics with different product meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>pass@k</strong>: probability of at least one success in k tries (good when “one working solution” is enough).</li><li><strong>pass^k</strong>: probability of succeeding on all k trials (good when users expect consistent success every time).</li></ul><p>This is a clean way to express a product requirement as a metric. Some agents are allowed to be “creative” across attempts; others must be boringly reliable.</p><h2>A practical roadmap to start</h2><p>The roadmap in the post is refreshingly 80/20. The core ideas:</p><ul><li>Start early, even with 20–50 tasks drawn from real failures.</li><li>Write unambiguous tasks; if two domain experts wouldn’t agree on pass/fail, the task is broken.</li><li>Create a reference solution per task to ensure the graders are configured correctly.</li><li>Build balanced problem sets (test both when a behavior should happen and when it shouldn’t).</li><li>Stabilize environments so trials start clean and noise comes from the agent, not the harness.</li></ul><p>The meta-lesson is that evaluation design is part of product design: you are deciding what “good” means, then making it executable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>There’s a tempting story going around: soon AI will write the code, and humans will “just” do architecture. It’s a pleasant fantasy because it turns software engineering into a clean split between thinking and typing.</p><p>The MIT CSAIL paper summarized by MIT News pushes back on that split. The thesis is simple and slightly brutal: code completion is the easy part; the hard part is everything else.</p><h2>Software engineering is not LeetCode</h2><p>One reason the narrative goes wrong is that it compresses software engineering into “the undergrad programming part”: implement a function from a neat spec, or solve an interview puzzle. Real work is broader and messier: refactors that slowly improve design, migrations that reshape a business, and an ongoing fight against bugs, regressions, and security issues.</p><p>MIT’s summary lists the kinds of tasks that dominate practice: large-scale migrations (e.g., moving millions of lines from COBOL to Java), continuous testing and analysis (fuzzing, property-based testing), and the maintenance grind (documentation, summarizing history for new teammates, reviewing pull requests for correctness, performance, security, and style).</p><p>This is why “AI writes code” is not the end of the story. The question is whether it can write code that belongs to a living codebase: one that already has conventions, constraints, unwritten assumptions, and a deployment pipeline that is merciless to small mistakes.</p><h2>Evaluation is the bottleneck</h2><p>Engineering organizations run on feedback loops. If AI is going to do real engineering work, we need strong ways to measure whether it improved the codebase or quietly made it worse.</p><p>The MIT News piece calls out a gap between what we evaluate and what we need. Many metrics and benchmarks are still biased toward short, self-contained tasks, while real high-stakes engineering includes performance-critical rewrites, long refactors, and multi-step changes that must survive integration and future edits.</p><p>It also notes that popular yardsticks like SWE-Bench—patching a GitHub issue—can be useful but remain close to the “small spec” paradigm, often touching only hundreds of lines. That leaves out scenarios like AI-assisted refactors, pair-programming workflows, and changes that span huge codebases or require careful performance validation.</p><h2>The thin control channel problem</h2><p>Even when code generation “works,” the developer experience can be fragile. MIT’s summary describes today’s interaction as a thin line: you ask for a change and get back a large, unstructured blob of code (sometimes with unit tests), but you still don’t have fine-grained control over the model’s decisions.</p><p>A key missing feature is an explicit uncertainty interface. In the article, Alex Gu points out that without a channel for the AI to surface confidence (“this part is solid, this part you should double-check”), teams risk trusting hallucinated logic that compiles and looks clean, but fails under production conditions.</p><p>Another missing piece is disciplined deferral: the model noticing when the request is underspecified and asking for clarification instead of guessing. In mature engineering, “ask before you guess” is not politeness; it’s reliability.</p><h2>Scale breaks the illusion</h2><p>Small demos hide the hardest part: context. The MIT News summary emphasizes that models struggle with large codebases (millions of lines) and with proprietary repositories where conventions, internal helpers, and architectural patterns are out-of-distribution relative to public GitHub training data.</p><p>The failure mode is painfully familiar: code that looks plausible but calls non-existent functions, violates internal style rules, or fails CI. The output is not “random”; it is specifically dangerous because it is coherent enough to pass a quick glance.</p><p>The same problem shows up in retrieval: the article notes that models can retrieve code that looks similar by name or syntax rather than by functionality. That is, the system finds something that matches the surface form, not the underlying semantics, and then builds on a false foundation.</p><h2>What changes for engineers</h2><p>The natural conclusion is not “AI can’t do it.” It’s that the profession’s leverage shifts from typing to constraint design. If implementation becomes cheap, the scarce skill becomes specifying intent precisely and building systems that reject incorrect work quickly.</p><p>Concretely, this means doubling down on tools and interfaces that make software behavior testable and inspectable: stronger regression suites, property-based tests where they pay off, better static analysis, better observability in production, and better benchmarks that measure things like refactor quality, bug-fix longevity, and migration correctness.</p><p>The framing that stuck with me is that the core engineering problem becomes: how to make a model a collaborator you can audit. Not “can it write code?”, but “can it expose its assumptions, surface uncertainty, and operate inside feedback loops that punish wrongness?”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">News MIT Edu</a></p>"

They become a way to name the failure modes early, while there is still time to design around them.</p><p>Stanford HAI’s “AI experts predict what will happen in 2026” is useful in that pragmatic sense. It frames the coming year less as a sequence of shiny releases and more as a set of tensions that will show up in ordinary life: who trusts what, what counts as evidence, what gets automated (and what shouldn’t), and how much opacity society is willing to tolerate.</p><h2>The real story: trust is now a product requirement</h2><p>When people ask whether a therapy chatbot can be trusted, that is not a niche “AI safety” question. It’s a demand for reliability in a context where mistakes are emotionally costly.</p><p>When employees worry their boss is automating the wrong job, they are not resisting technology. They are pointing out that automation has second-order effects: it reshapes incentives, desksills teams, and changes what gets measured.</p><p>And when users worry their private conversations are training tomorrow’s models, they are implicitly asking for enforceable boundaries, not marketing language.</p><p>In other words, 2026 is not primarily about capability. It’s about trustworthiness becoming legible and auditable enough that non-experts can reason about it.</p><h2>Transparency is becoming a competitive axis</h2><p>There’s a weird inversion happening. As models get stronger, public visibility into how they are built and evaluated can get weaker.</p><p>This is partly business reality: the incentives of competition push toward secrecy. But it creates a governance gap, because you can’t meaningfully assess risk without basic information about training, evaluation, and deployment constraints.</p><p>In 2026, “transparent enough” will matter across multiple layers:</p><ul><li><strong>For users</strong>: what data is used, what is retained, and what choices exist.</li><li><strong>For organizations</strong>: what gets logged, what can be audited, and what can be turned off.</li><li><strong>For regulators and the public</strong>: what claims are supported by evidence rather than vibes.</li></ul><p>The bad equilibrium is predictable: opacity rises, trust erodes, then policy arrives as a blunt instrument. The better equilibrium is also clear: transparency becomes a feature, and systems that can prove what they do earn adoption.</p><h2>Automation will be judged by what it breaks</h2><p>Most automation narratives focus on what becomes faster. The more honest question is what becomes fragile.</p><p>Automating the wrong work can remove exactly the parts of a job that keep the system safe: informal checks, human intuition for edge cases, and the quiet responsibility people feel when they own an outcome.</p><p>A useful way to think about 2026 is that automation will move from “can we do it?” to “what does it do to the surrounding system?” That includes workplaces, education, and even personal relationships with information.</p><h2>Privacy is no longer a preference, it’s a boundary condition</h2><p>The old framing was: privacy is a personal value, so users can trade it for convenience.</p><p>The new framing is: privacy is the condition that makes some uses acceptable at all. If conversations that feel private are later repurposed into training data, adoption becomes socially unstable. People will self-censor, avoid sensitive use cases, and treat AI systems as untrustworthy witnesses.</p><p>So the practical question for 2026 is not “does the model work?” It is “does the system have clear, enforceable data boundaries, and can those boundaries survive normal operational pressure?”</p><h2>What to do with these predictions (if you build or teach)</h2><p>Predictions are only useful if they change behavior. A few concrete moves that follow from the pressures Stanford highlights:</p><ul><li><strong>Prefer systems with controllable data flows</strong>: retention settings, clear opt-ins, and the ability to separate sensitive work from general usage.</li><li><strong>Instrument verification</strong>: require sources, logs, and traces where appropriate, and make “I don’t know” an acceptable output.</li><li><strong>Design for misuse and misunderstanding</strong>: assume users will over-trust confident language, and build guardrails that reduce that harm.</li><li><strong>Teach epistemic hygiene</strong>: not prompt tricks, but habits of checking, comparing, and stating uncertainty.</li></ul><p>If 2025 was the year people learned models could do impressive things, 2026 looks like the year society learns the uncomfortable part: impressive is cheap, but trustworthy is engineered.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/stanford-ai-experts-predict-what-will-happen-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stanford Edu</a></p>"

In NotebookLM, the report is an intermediate artifact you can pull into your notebook and then keep interrogating.</p><p>This is the workflow shift: instead of asking the model to be correct in one shot, you ask the system to assemble a corpus and then you do iterative thinking on top of it.</p><h2>The report is just the beginning</h2><p>NotebookLM explicitly frames Deep Research as a bootstrap mechanism: you can add the report and its sources into the notebook, then continue working with the rest of your materials while Deep Research runs in the background.</p><p>That matters because “research” is rarely linear. The moment you read something interesting, you want to pull in adjacent sources, compare claims, extract definitions, and rewrite your mental model. The faster you can do that without leaving the workspace, the more likely you are to stay in a productive state.</p><p>In practice, this also changes how prompts should be written. Instead of prompting for answers, prompt for corpus-building: what sources are missing, which concepts need multiple viewpoints, what is likely to be misunderstood, what should be verified, and what deserves an explicit counterexample.</p><h2>Why this makes an AI workflow efficient</h2><p>There’s a predictable pattern in knowledge work:</p><ul><li>At the beginning you need breadth (coverage, vocabulary, map of the territory).</li><li>Then you need structure (a plan, a taxonomy, a set of subquestions).</li><li>Finally you need compression (a brief, a lesson, a decision memo, a publishable draft).</li></ul><p>Deep Research is a direct attempt to speed up the breadth phase without losing traceability, because the output is grounded in sources you can keep attached to the notebook.</p><p>It also reduces the worst productivity killer: repeated “reloading” of context.

The claim is closer to an engineering principle: if the domain is inherently dual-use, then the response has to be defense-in-depth, continuously updated, and anchored to real-world defender workflows.</p><h2>Why “defenders first” is a real constraint</h2><p>In security, “build for defenders” is not a slogan; it’s an allocation decision. It means prioritizing capabilities that make audits faster, vulnerability discovery more systematic, and incident response less chaotic—especially in teams that are under-resourced compared to attackers.</p><p>Third-party reporting summarizing OpenAI’s position emphasizes defensive tooling as the priority as advanced systems expand, with investments aimed at helping teams audit code, patch vulnerabilities, and respond more effectively to threats.

Simon Willison’s comprehensive review of the year identifies \"reasoning\" as the defining trend, driven by a technique known as Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This shift has fundamentally changed how we interact with these systems, moving us from chat interfaces to asynchronous agentic workflows.</p><h2>The \"Reasoning\" Unlock: RLVR</h2><p>For a mathematician, the shift to RLVR is the most significant architectural change. By training models against automatically verifiable environments—such as math puzzles or code execution—labs like OpenAI (with o1/o3) and DeepSeek (with R1) taught models to develop problem-solving strategies. As Andrej Karpathy noted, these models learn to break down problems and \"backtrack\" when they hit a dead end. This isn't just about better conversation; it's about allocating compute to <em>inference time</em> rather than just pre-training. Willison points out that this capability is what finally made AI-assisted search and complex debugging reliable: the model can reason about its own errors.</p><h2>The Era of Coding Agents and \"YOLO Mode\"</h2><p>The practical application of this reasoning is the \"coding agent.\" The release of Claude Code defined the year, moving developers away from copy-pasting code snippets to using <strong>asynchronous agents</strong> that run in the background. These tools can plan multi-step tasks, execute code, inspect the results, and iterate. However, Willison highlights a critical security trade-off: the \"Normalization of Deviance.\" To make these agents useful, developers are increasingly running them in \"YOLO mode\" (bypassing approval prompts), granting autonomous AI systems read/write access to their local environments—a practice that feels efficient until it inevitably isn't.</p><h2>Conformance Suites as Prompts</h2><p>Perhaps the most exciting development for those of us who value formal rigor is the rise of <strong>conformance suites</strong>. Willison observed that the most effective way to drive a 2025-era agent isn't a text prompt, but a rigorous test suite. If you provide a model with a comprehensive set of tests (like the html5lib tests or a WebAssembly spec), it can iterate independently until the implementation passes. This aligns perfectly with formal verification methods: the \"spec\" becomes the instruction, and the agent becomes the implementation engine.</p><h2>The Open Weight Geopolitics</h2><p>Finally, the monopoly on intelligence fractured in 2025. Chinese labs released open-weight models (like DeepSeek V3 and Qwen 2.5) that didn't just catch up to US models—they occasionally beat them, causing temporary panic in US markets (specifically impacting NVIDIA). Alongside Google's custom TPU-driven Gemini ecosystem, this has created a diverse, highly competitive field where \"state-of-the-art\" changes monthly.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simon Willison's Weblog</a></p>"

The signal from 2024/2025 is clear: <strong>inference-time compute</strong> is not just a prompting trick; it is a training objective.</p>\n\n<p>The breakthrough for local labs is that we no longer need the massive infrastructure required for PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization). We have moved to <strong>GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)</strong>, which removes the need for a critic model and fits reasoning training onto a single consumer GPU.</p>\n\n<h2>The Shift: From Imitation (SFT) to Incentive (GRPO)</h2>\n<p>In SFT, the model learns to predict the next token in a \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) trace. The problem? If the trace contains a logical jump or a hallucination, the model memorizes the error just as firmly as the truth.</p>\n\n<p>GRPO changes the game by sampling a <em>group</em> of outputs for the same prompt and optimizing based on a reward function (correctness of the final answer). The policy is updated to maximize the probability of outputs that score higher than the group average.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the baseline is computed from the group mean, not a separate value network. This cuts VRAM usage nearly in half, making it possible to train reasoning behaviors on a 24GB card.</p>\n\n<h2>The Stack: Unsloth + Qwen-2.5-Math</h2>\n<p>The most viable path for a home lab right now involves <strong>Unsloth</strong>. They have integrated GRPO directly into their training pipeline. You don't need a complex reward model for math; you just need a deterministic way to check the final answer.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the stripped-down logic for a local GRPO run:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from unsloth import FastLanguageModel, PatchFastRL\nPatchFastRL(\"GRPO\", FastLanguageModel)\n\n# 1. Load a strong base model (Qwen-2.5-Math-7B is excellent)\nmodel, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(\n    \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-7B\",\n    load_in_4bit = True\n)\n\n# 2. Define a verifiable reward function\ndef reward_correctness(prompts, completions, answer, **kwargs):\n    # Extract answer from completion and match with ground truth\n    return [1.0 if extract_answer(c) == a else 0.0 for c, a in zip(completions, answer)]\n\n# 3. Train with Group Sampling (GRPO)\ntrainer = GRPOTrainer(\n    model = model,\n    reward_funcs = [reward_correctness],\n    args = GRPOConfig(\n        per_device_train_batch_size = 1, \n        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,\n        num_generations = 4, # Group size\n        max_prompt_length = 512,\n        max_completion_length = 1024,\n    ),\n)\ntrainer.train()</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Why this matters for Mathematicians</h2>\n<p>This approach allows us to train models that <strong>self-correct</strong>. By rewarding only the final answer, we allow the model to \"learn\" that spending more tokens to double-check its work (or backtrack) leads to a higher reward.

What’s actually happening is less romantic and (to me) more interesting: we are learning how to make discovery <em>operational</em>.</p>\n\n<p>“Operational” here means a loop you can run: translate a problem into a formal object, generate candidate steps, check them, and feed the verified signal back into the system. Not a single shot “answer”, but a process that can grind for hours, days, weeks—without drifting into hallucination.</p>\n\n<h2>Why formal systems change the game</h2>\n<p>If you’ve used Isabelle/HOL, Lean, Coq, or friends, you already know the key point: a proof assistant is not impressed by eloquence. It accepts only a proof that type-checks and reduces where it should. That strictness is exactly what current language models lack in natural language mode: they can be persuasive while being wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The deep idea in many recent systems is to exploit a verifier as the ultimate critic. The model is allowed to be creative and messy, but every step gets forced through a tiny gate: does the checker accept it?</p>\n\n<h2>DeepMind’s IMO result as a case study</h2>\n<p>DeepMind described a system that reached silver-medal level on the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad by combining two complementary components: AlphaProof (focused on formal reasoning in Lean via reinforcement learning) and AlphaGeometry 2 (a neuro-symbolic geometry solver with a fast symbolic engine). That pairing matters: one part searches proofs in a formal language, the other has domain-specific geometry machinery.</p>\n\n<p>Two details are worth noticing. First, the IMO problems were manually translated into a formal language before the systems could work on them, which highlights that “autoformalization” is still a major bottleneck. Second, once in the formal domain, the systems could spend serious compute time exploring proof space, and the correctness of any found proof is not a vibe—it is mechanically verified.</p>\n\n<h2>The real frontier: conjectures, not just solutions</h2>\n<p>Solving a fixed problem is already hard, but discovery is often about proposing the right intermediate statements. In practice, mathematicians don’t move linearly from axioms to theorem; they invent lemmas, strengthen hypotheses, and adjust definitions until the landscape becomes navigable.</p>\n\n<p>AI systems that live inside a formal environment (Lean, Isabelle, etc.) can in principle search not only for proofs but for useful stepping stones—lemmas that shorten proofs, reusable tactics, or alternative formulations that make automation feasible. That’s where “math discovery” starts to feel real: not replacing insight, but mass-producing plausible local moves and letting the verifier keep only the ones that survive.</p>\n\n<h2>What this suggests for working mathematicians</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Verification becomes the backbone</strong>: any workflow that keeps the model tethered to a proof checker avoids the most damaging failure mode (confident nonsense).</li>\n<li><strong>Human time shifts</strong>: less time spent on low-level bookkeeping and more time spent choosing definitions, deciding which subproblems matter, and interpreting what a formal proof is actually saying.</li>\n<li><strong>Autoformalization is strategic</strong>: the moment “informal → formal” becomes reliable, the space of problems accessible to these loops expands dramatically.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of this guarantees new Fields-level theorems in the short term. But it does point to a plausible medium-term reality: mathematicians using AI the way programmers use compilers and fuzzers—tools that don’t supply meaning, but relentlessly enforce correctness while exploring huge spaces of possibilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DeepMind Blog</a></p>"

Before asking an agent to make changes, he assesses the potential impact: is this a small, atomic commit (a \"small bomb\") or a massive refactor (a \"Fat Man\")?</p><p>This is engineering intuition applied to AI. You don't need a formal \"plan mode\" for every tweak, but you do need to know when to stop, check the status, or ask for options before proceeding. It turns the interaction from a \"prompt and pray\" loop into a collaborative steering process.</p><h2>Collapsing the complexity</h2><p>The post argues that many tools (MCPs, heavy frameworks) are solving problems that are rapidly disappearing. With effective context windows reaching ~230k tokens and models like GPT-5-codex, the need for RAG over a codebase diminishes. The model can simply read the relevant files.</p><p>Steinberger suggests that we are moving past the phase of needing complex scaffolding to make models useful.

      "content": "<p>We often treat command-line tools as pure utility: scripts to be piped, args to be parsed, and exit codes to be checked. But as computing pioneer Alan Kay noted, the command line remains the most <em>versatile</em> corner of the computer, offering a depth GUIs cannot afford. The Command Line Interface Guidelines (CLIG) proposes a necessary modernization: shifting from a <strong>machine-first</strong> tradition to a <strong>human-first</strong> design philosophy.</p><h2>The Baggage of the Past</h2><p>Traditional UNIX philosophy optimized for composability and brevity—machines talking to machines. This often resulted in opaque error messages and the silent treatment on success (the classic &quot;no news is good news&quot; approach of <code>cp</code>). CLIG argues that today’s terminal is primarily a human workspace. If a command changes the state of the system, it should explicitly tell the user what happened, much like <code>git push</code> details exactly which refs were updated, rather than just returning exit code 0.</p><h2>Conversation as the Interface</h2><p>The guide introduces a powerful metaphor: <em>conversation</em>. Using a CLI is a dialogue where the user proposes an intent, and the program responds. This reframes error handling not as a crash, but as a corrective turn in the conversation. </p><p>For instance, if I run <code>brew update jq</code>, the tool shouldn&#39;t just fail; it should gently suggest, <em>&quot;Did you mean `brew upgrade jq`?&quot;</em> This is empathy in software design. It acknowledges that the user is learning through repeated trial-and-error.</p><h2>Concrete Heuristics for Modern Tools</h2><p>The document is rich with specific implementation details that distinguish a &quot;toy&quot; script from a professional tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Context-Aware Output (The TTY Rule)</strong>: Your program must know its audience. If <code>stdout</code> is an interactive terminal, give me colors, spinners, and human-readable tables. If it’s being piped to a file or another command, strip the ANSI codes and animations immediately. A progress bar in a CI log isn&#39;t a feature; it&#39;s a corrupt log file.</li><li><strong>The &quot;Help&quot; Hierarchy</strong>: Documentation isn&#39;t an afterthought. CLIG suggests a tiered approach: running the command bare should show concise usage examples (like <code>jq</code>), while <code>--help</code> should provide the full manual. Crucially, lead with <strong>examples</strong>, not syntax definitions. Users learn by pattern-matching, not by reading Backus–Naur form.</li><li><strong>Flags over Arguments</strong>: Positional arguments are brittle relics. While <code>cp source dest</code> is standard, it is also ambiguous. Modern tools should prefer flags (<code>--file</code>, <code>--output</code>) which are explicit, order-independent, and extensible without breaking backward compatibility.</li><li><strong>JSON as a First-Class Citizen</strong>: Since we operate in a web-centric world, tools should support a <code>--json</code> flag. This allows users to bypass text parsing tools like <code>awk</code> and pipe structured data directly into <code>jq</code> or networked services.</li></ul><h2>Why this matters</h2><p>I value this guide because it treats CLI design with the same rigor we apply to graphical interfaces. It recognizes that <strong>robustness</strong> is a subjective feeling—a tool that catches interrupts (<code>Ctrl-C</code>) gracefully and provides feedback in under 100ms feels &quot;solid,&quot; regardless of its actual execution time. A well-designed CLI respects my time by being discoverable and respects my mental model by being consistent.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://clig.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Command Line Interface Guidelines</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>Google is turning Gemini into a built-in layer inside Classroom, and it’s now positioned as a no-cost suite of tools for educators with Google Workspace for Education accounts, with 30+ features aimed at saving time on common teaching tasks.</p><p>That sounds like convenience, but it’s also a curriculum stress test: if the tool can generate the “school-shaped” artifact instantly, then the assignment has to move up a level and grade the process, not the polish.</p><h2>The shift: from tool-use to task design</h2><p>When AI is always available, the question isn’t “can students use it?” but “what exactly counts as learning, and how do we make it observable?” The fastest way to get this wrong is to keep the same prompts, the same rubrics, the same homework format—and just hope honesty wins.</p><p>Instead, treat AI like a new medium. The job becomes designing tasks where AI output is allowed, but shallow thinking is not.</p><h2>Three rules for AI-native assignments</h2><h3>1) Make the process gradeable</h3><p>Use a simple structure that forces students to show work:</p><ul><li><strong>Draft A (human):</strong> messy, incomplete, but honest.</li><li><strong>Draft B (AI-assisted):</strong> revised with Gemini (or any model).</li><li><strong>Decision log:</strong> 8–12 bullet points explaining what changed and why.</li></ul><p>Grade the decision log like an argument: clarity, tradeoffs, and whether the student can justify accepting or rejecting suggestions.</p><h3>2) Require verification, not just fluency</h3><p>AI makes “sounds right” dangerously cheap. So build a verification step into the deliverable:</p><ul><li>Two external sources (not AI) supporting or contradicting key claims.</li><li>A “conflict note” when sources disagree.</li><li>A final paragraph titled <em>What I’m still unsure about</em>.</li></ul><p>This turns AI output into a hypothesis generator, not an authority.</p><h3>3) Anchor authenticity with short orals</h3><p>Keep AI in homework if desired—but shift authenticity checks into class:</p><ul><li>3-minute micro-viva: explain one key choice from the decision log.</li><li>Live “debug”: fix one weak paragraph without AI.</li><li>One-minute source defense: why that source is credible.</li></ul><p>The point isn’t to punish AI use; it’s to reward understanding.</p><h2>How Classroom features map to these rules</h2><p>Gemini in Classroom is framed around helping educators kickstart lessons, differentiate materials, and generate things like quizzes and rubrics.</p><p>Used well, that time savings can be reinvested into better task constraints (the part that actually drives learning).</p><ul><li><strong>Rubrics:</strong> Generate a first draft rubric, then add explicit criteria for “decision quality” and “verification quality.”</li><li><strong>Teacher-led NotebookLM in Classroom:</strong> Create a study guide and Audio Overview grounded only in teacher-provided materials, then ask students to extract claims + evidence from that bounded set.</li><li><strong>Teacher-led Gems in Classroom:</strong> Build a “Quiz me” or “Study partner” Gem that helps students practice, but require them to cite exactly which class resource the answer came from.</li></ul><p>Google also describes upcoming or expanding analytics and standards-based tracking—tagging coursework to learning standards, viewing performance analytics, and surfacing insights like missing assignments or improving grades.</p><p>That matters because AI-native assessment often creates more small artifacts (logs, checks, orals). Analytics can help spot who is falling behind early, before the gap becomes permanent.</p><h2>A 30-minute rollout plan (realistic)</h2><p>If there’s only time for one iteration, start here:</p><ol><li>Pick one writing assignment already in the next two weeks.</li><li>Use Gemini to draft the rubric, then add 2 criteria: “Decision log quality” and “Verification quality.”</li><li>Create one bounded support artifact (NotebookLM study guide grounded in your uploaded materials).</li><li>Add a 3-minute micro-viva at the start of next lesson: each student defends one decision from their log.</li><li>Use Classroom insights/analytics to follow up with students who missed steps (not just the final submission).</li></ol><p>This approach doesn’t require perfect policy. It requires a repeatable structure.</p><h2>The hidden risk: outsourcing as a habit</h2><p>AI can make school feel easier while learning becomes thinner. The antidote is not banning, but redesigning tasks so effort shifts from typing to judgment: selecting, verifying, defending, and revising under constraints.</p><p>If students learn that “good work” means “good decisions,” AI becomes a lever for learning instead of a shortcut around it.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/classroom-ai-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Blog</a></p>"

Cloudflare recently shared how they built their automated maintenance scheduler, and the evolution of their architecture is a textbook example of hitting the limits of naive implementations.</p><p>The problem is classic constraint satisfaction: With data centers in 330+ cities, you can't just turn off a router for maintenance whenever you feel like it. You have to ensure that doing so doesn't isolate a region or break a specific customer's routing rule (like their \"Aegis\" product, which binds traffic to specific IPs).</p><h2>The \"Naive\" Approach vs. The Graph</h2><p>Their first attempt was to load all the data—server relationships, product configs, health metrics—into a single Worker. Unsurprisingly, this hit memory limits immediately. You can't fit the state of a global network into a single ephemeral function's RAM.</p><p>The fix was to shift mental models from \"loading a dataset\" to \"traversing a graph.\" They adopted an object-association model inspired by Facebook's TAO. Instead of \"give me all Aegis pools,\" the query becomes \"give me the Aegis pools associated with <em>this</em> specific datacenter.\"</p><p>This reduced response sizes by 100x, but introduced a new problem: the \"N+1 query\" issue, or what they call the \"thundering herd\" of tiny requests.</p><h2>Middleware as the Hero</h2><p>To solve the request volume, they built a fetch pipeline middleware that handles:</p><ul><li><strong>Deduplication:</strong> Merging identical in-flight requests (similar to Go's <code>singleflight</code>).</li><li><strong>LRU Caching:</strong> A tiny in-memory cache for the immediate execution context.</li><li><strong>CDN Caching:</strong> Caching GET requests at the edge with careful TTLs (1 minute for real-time data, hours for static infrastructure data).</li></ul><p>The result was a ~99% cache hit rate. It’s a great reminder that when you move to micro-requests, the network overhead becomes your new bottleneck, and caching strategy becomes your primary optimization lever.</p><h2>What I take from this</h2><p>The most interesting part for me wasn't the scheduler itself, but the pivot to <strong>Parquet files on R2</strong> for historical analysis.</p><p>Querying months of Prometheus TSDB blocks from object storage is painfully slow because of random reads. By converting that data to Parquet (a columnar format), they could issue precise range requests, fetching only the specific columns needed. They report a 15x performance improvement. It’s a strong argument for using big-data formats even in operational tooling when the scale gets large enough.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-our-maintenance-scheduler-on-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cloudflare — Building our maintenance scheduler</a></p>"

The keynote was heavy on metaphors—something about AI not being a \"cherry on top\" but the ice cream itself—but if you look past the marketing, they are acknowledging a hard truth: chatbots are cool, but they aren't actually <em>integrated</em> yet.</p><h2>Making AI Understand \"Work\"</h2><p>The most promising update is something they call <strong>Work IQ</strong>. It’s an attempt to give the model a memory of your actual workday—your habits, your colleagues, and the specific jargon your team uses.</p><p>This feels like the right move. The reason most enterprise AI demos fall flat is the \"cold start\" problem. You have to explain everything to the bot every time. If Work IQ actually works, it stops the AI from being a generic consultant and turns it into a team member that already has the context.</p><h2>The \"Shadow AI\" Problem</h2><p>There was one number in the announcement that actually made me sit up: they are projecting <strong>1.3 billion AI agents by 2028</strong>.</p><p>Think about that for a second. We used to worry about \"Shadow IT\"—employees using unauthorized Dropbox accounts or Trello boards.

It lets IT admins see, secure, and govern these agents. It sounds boring, but honestly, it’s probably the most critical feature they announced. Without it, that swarm of 1.3 billion agents is just a security nightmare waiting to happen.</p><h2>Getting the Plumbing Right</h2><p>They also introduced <strong>Fabric IQ</strong> and <strong>Foundry IQ</strong> to help connect raw data to these agents. It’s less flashy than a new LLM release, but it confirms a trend I’m seeing everywhere: the \"magic\" phase of AI is over.</p><p>We are firmly in the plumbing phase now. It’s no longer about how smart the model is; it’s about whether you can hook it up to your real data without breaking everything.

      "content": "<p>AI models are quickly turning into critical infrastructure: they shape how people search, write, create, and make decisions at scale. Yet a Stanford-led research team argues that the industry is moving in the opposite direction on disclosure, with companies increasingly withholding information that would enable meaningful scrutiny.</p><p>The findings come from the <em>2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index</em>, which evaluates major AI developers on a 100-point scale across areas such as training data disclosure, risk mitigation, and broader impacts. According to the index, the overall level of transparency is low, and it has declined compared to the previous year.</p><h2>What the index measures</h2><p>The Foundation Model Transparency Index is designed to score how much companies disclose about their flagship foundation models and related practices. It spans multiple dimensions—such as where data comes from, what safety processes exist, and what is known about downstream use and impacts—because transparency isn’t a single checkbox: it’s a collection of concrete, verifiable disclosures.</p><p>In 2025, the index assessed 13 companies and found large variation in disclosure practices. The average score was about 40/100, and companies tended to fall into three rough clusters: top performers around 75, a middle group around 35, and low scorers around 15.</p><h2>Big gaps between companies</h2><p>One striking result is how uneven disclosure has become. IBM sits at the top with a reported 95/100—described as the highest score in the index’s history—and is highlighted for providing unusually detailed information, including enough detail for external researchers to replicate training data practices and allowing access for external entities such as auditors.</p><p>At the other end, xAI and Midjourney are reported at 14/100, with the write-up stating they share essentially no information about training data, risks, or mitigation steps. The overall picture is not just “some companies are better than others,” but that a meaningful portion of the market is operating with minimal public accountability.</p><h2>The environmental blind spot</h2><p>The Stanford HAI write-up emphasizes a major omission across the board: environmental impact. It claims that 10 of the assessed companies disclose none of the key information related to environmental impact (including energy usage, carbon emissions, or water use), which matters because datacenter expansion and training workloads have real-world resource costs.</p><p>This is a practical transparency issue, not a philosophical one. Without standardized disclosures, it becomes difficult for policymakers, researchers, and even customers to compare footprint claims or validate sustainability commitments.</p><h2>Openness isn’t the same as transparency</h2><p>A useful distinction in the piece is that “open” (publishing model weights) doesn’t automatically mean “transparent” (explaining practices and impacts). The write-up warns that even influential open-weight developers can still be opaque about core items like training compute, risk assessment, and downstream use.</p><p>This matters because public debate often treats open-weight releases as a proxy for accountability. The index argues that assumption is risky: disclosure must be specific, structured, and repeatable to support real oversight.</p><h2>Why this matters now</h2><p>The researchers frame transparency as an “essential public good” for governance, harm mitigation, and oversight, and they point to growing policy interest in mandating disclosures for frontier AI risks. They also note that the index aims to help identify which transparency areas resist improvement without policy pressure.</p><p>Even if one disagrees with any single score, the direction of travel is the key signal: as foundation models become more central to economies and institutions, baseline disclosure is not keeping up.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p><p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/transparency-in-ai-is-on-the-decline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stanford Edu News</a></p>"

Faster code, less waste, fewer resources burned. Their name for the practice is <em>Continuous Efficiency</em>: incremental, validated improvements that accumulate over time instead of arriving as a big “green refactor” that never gets scheduled.</p><h2>Why “continuous” is the point</h2><p>Most teams already have habits that run continuously: tests, linters, formatting, security checks, CI. Continuous Efficiency tries to join that family. The promise is not magic optimization; it’s that small improvements can happen regularly, be measured, and be reviewed—so the codebase gently trends toward being cheaper to run and easier to maintain.</p><h2>Where AI fits</h2><p>The key enabling idea is combining Continuous AI (automation enriched by modern LLMs inside collaboration workflows) with Green Software practices (building systems that are more energy-efficient and typically more performant and resilient). In the best case, this turns sustainability from “extra work” into “default behavior”.</p><h2>Agentic workflows as a delivery mechanism</h2><p>One concrete implementation discussed is an experimental approach called Agentic Workflows running in GitHub Actions. The interesting part is authoring: instead of writing traditional automation logic, you describe intent in natural language inside a Markdown file, then compile it into a standard workflow. At runtime an agent can inspect repository context, propose changes, and surface them through familiar collaboration artifacts like comments and pull requests—while staying within the guardrails of the platform.</p><h2>Standards, rules, and performance work</h2><p>Two directions stand out. First, turning standards into executable rules: describe what “good” looks like, then apply it across a codebase more broadly than conventional pattern-based tooling. Second, performance improvement in heterogeneous real-world repos: an iterative approach where an agent can discover how to build and benchmark a project, run measurements, and propose targeted optimizations under human guidance.</p><p>I like this because it doesn’t pretend expertise disappears. Instead, it tries to scale it: making improvements easier to start, easier to validate, and easier to repeat—so teams can keep learning in public, but also keep their software lean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/the-future-of-ai-powered-software-optimization-and-how-it-can-help-your-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub Blog</a></p>"

You need prompts, scenarios, transcripts, scoring rubrics, infrastructure, and then you discover your evaluation is either too easy, too gameable, or already obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic’s <em>Bloom</em> is a direct response to that pain: a pipeline meant to generate behavioral evaluations quickly, for arbitrary behaviors, and to output numbers you can track over time.</p>\n\n<h2>What Bloom is trying to solve</h2>\n<p>Behavioral evaluations matter most when they measure something messy and real: deception, sabotage, self-preservation, sycophancy, bias, “evaluation awareness”, and other traits that do not show up cleanly in typical benchmark QA.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that building these evaluations by hand is slow, and once they exist they can go stale. Models train on similar data, capabilities shift, and what once was a strong test turns into a predictable obstacle course.</p>\n\n<p>Bloom’s bet is that evaluation creation itself should be automated and <em>regenerated</em> repeatedly, so you measure the same underlying behavior but with fresh scenarios each time.</p>\n\n<h2>The core idea: an assembly line for evaluations</h2>\n<p>Bloom is structured like an agentic assembly line that starts with a researcher’s description of a target behavior and ends with a scored evaluation suite.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, the pipeline has four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understanding</strong>: interpret what the behavior means and what “counts” as evidence for it.</li>\n<li><strong>Ideation</strong>: generate many scenarios designed to elicit the behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Rollout</strong>: run those scenarios, simulating users (and sometimes tools) to produce transcripts.</li>\n<li><strong>Judgment</strong>: score transcripts for presence/severity of the behavior and summarize suite-level metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This structure matters because it separates “what we want to measure” from “how we elicit it” and from “how we judge it”. That modularity is what makes iteration fast.</p>\n\n<h2>Why I find this useful</h2>\n<p>Bloom reads like an attempt to make alignment measurement feel more like engineering than philosophy. Instead of arguing abstractly about whether a model is safe, you can track an elicitation rate, compare runs, and monitor regressions after model updates.</p>\n\n<p>Another subtle benefit: because scenarios can be generated anew each run (while still being reproducible via a seed), Bloom is less dependent on a fixed evaluation set. That helps reduce the “teaching to the test” dynamic where benchmarks slowly become training targets.</p>\n\n<h2>The practical workflow shift</h2>\n<p>What changes for practitioners is not just speed, but cadence. Bloom encourages a loop like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a behavior you actually worry about in deployment.</li>\n<li>Generate a first suite, inspect failures, refine the behavior description and configuration.</li>\n<li>Run at scale, compare across models, and keep the seed as the thing you cite and rerun.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That’s much closer to how teams maintain reliability in production systems: frequent tests, updated test cases, clear metrics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/bloom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic Research: Bloom</a>.</p>"

      "content": "<p>A year-in-review from a major lab is rarely just a recap. It’s closer to a strategy document: a curated list of what they want you to believe matters, and a hint of what they plan to compound next.</p><p>Google Research frames 2025 as an accelerating “magic cycle” where research turns into products faster, and products generate new needs that shape the next research agenda. Read that literally and it’s corporate storytelling. Read it operationally and it’s a useful model of how modern AI progress actually compounds: deploy, measure, adapt, repeat.</p><h2>The stack is tightening</h2><p>The most revealing part of the recap is that it treats generative AI as a full-stack system, not a single model upgrade. The headline improvements are about making models more efficient, more factual, more multilingual and multi-cultural, and more capable across modalities (images, audio, video, 3D). That list matters because it’s a description of where real-world friction lives: cost, correctness, global usability, and robustness outside text-only sandboxes.</p><p>There’s also a strong retrieval theme: Google highlights work on retrieval-augmented generation and even the idea that a system can detect when it has “enough information” to answer correctly. That’s an important mindset shift, because it reframes retrieval as a control problem (when to stop, when to abstain, when to ask for more), not just “let’s add a search box to the model.”</p><h2>Factuality is becoming an engineering discipline</h2><p>Plenty of labs talk about truthfulness. Google’s recap reads like they’re trying to turn factuality into something closer to an engineering discipline: benchmarks, datasets, uncertainty signaling, and mechanisms for grounding in external context.</p><p>The deeper point is that “being factual” isn’t a single property of a model. It’s an end-to-end behavior that emerges from training, retrieval, evaluation, and how the product decides to present an answer. If this is right, then the next competitive advantage won’t come from who can generate the nicest paragraph—it’ll come from who can build systems that reliably know what they know.</p><h2>Generative UI is the quiet platform shift</h2><p>The recap’s most product-shaped idea is “generative UI”: models generating interactive interfaces (web pages, games, tools, apps) in response to a prompt. That sounds like a gimmick until you realize what it implies: the model isn’t just outputting text, it’s outputting a usable artifact that changes what the user can do next.</p><p>This matters because interfaces are leverage. If a model can produce a small interactive tool that constrains the problem, collects the right inputs, and surfaces the right outputs, the user stops “prompting” and starts operating a mini-application. That’s a different workflow, and it’s one reason AI products are drifting toward interactive, multimodal experiences instead of chat boxes.</p><h2>Science is getting agentified</h2><p>The scientific side of the recap is ambitious: multi-agent systems like an “AI co-scientist” for hypothesis generation, plus coding-agent tooling meant to help scientists write and iterate empirical software. The framing is consistent: reduce the cycle time of research by turning the overhead (searching, synthesizing, coding, re-running) into something that can be parallelized and automated.</p><p>Even if you discount the big claims, the direction is clear: AI is being positioned less as a universal oracle and more as a workflow accelerator that can run many small, checkable steps fast. If this pattern holds, the scientists who benefit most won’t be the ones who ask better questions—they’ll be the ones who instrument their work so the model can actually help.</p><h2>Planetary intelligence is a product category now</h2><p>Another thread that feels distinctly “Google” is Earth-scale intelligence: geospatial reasoning, crisis resilience, wildfire and flood forecasting, and climate tools that ship into real surfaces. What’s interesting is not that Google has models—it’s that they’re blending remote sensing, weather, maps, and reasoning into products meant to generate actionable insights.</p><p>This is also where the “magic cycle” becomes visible: deployment forces evaluation. When a system is used for flood alerts, fire detection, or cyclone forecasts, the cost of being wrong is explicit, and the feedback loop becomes sharper than any benchmark.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/google-research-2025-bolder-breakthroughs-bigger-impact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Research 2025</a></p>"

      "content": "<p>Reasoning models that think out loud via chain-of-thought (CoT) create a natural opening for oversight: if we can see intermediate steps, we can spot problems before they become actions. But that only works if the thinking trace is honest, interpretable, and predictive of behavior. OpenAI's new monitorability framework directly tackles that question: are CoT traces actually useful for monitoring, or just plausible-sounding narratives?</p>\n\n<h2>Three ways to test monitorability</h2>\n<p>The evaluation suite organizes 13 distinct tests across 24 environments into three archetypes, each probing a different aspect of how well reasoning traces support human oversight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intervention tests:</strong> Can we steer or interrupt problematic reasoning patterns? If the trace reflects genuine deliberation, targeted interventions should shift behavior predictably.</li>\n<li><strong>Process tests:</strong> Do thinking traces represent actual reasoning steps, or are they post-hoc justifications? This checks for faithfulness—whether the model's internal process matches what it writes.</li>\n<li><strong>Outcome-property tests:</strong> Do more monitorable thoughts correlate with safer or more accurate outcomes? If reasoning quality predicts result quality, monitoring becomes actionable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why this matters for deployment</h2>\n<p>Advanced reasoning models are increasingly used in agentic settings where they execute multi-step workflows with real consequences. Monitoring becomes critical in domains where reward-hacking, unsafe shortcuts, or subtle misalignment could be catastrophic.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI's companion paper shows this isn't hypothetical: they successfully monitored o3-mini for reward hacking in agentic coding environments using GPT-4o as the monitor—meaning a weaker model could effectively oversee a stronger one by observing its chain-of-thought.</p>\n\n<h2>The fragility problem</h2>\n<p>One key finding is that monitorability isn't automatic or stable. As models scale up test-time compute or undergo reinforcement learning, reasoning traces can become longer without becoming more faithful. The evaluation framework helps developers track whether increased thinking effort actually improves oversight or just adds noise.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly important because a convincing-sounding trace isn't proof of reliable reasoning—it could be optimized to look good to evaluators while hiding the actual decision process.</p>\n\n<h2>What changes for practitioners</h2>\n<p>The practical takeaway is to measure monitorability as a first-class property, not assume it comes for free with CoT. Teams building with reasoning models should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run monitorability evaluations periodically, especially after scaling compute or applying RL tuning.</li>\n<li>Prefer process-based rewards in safety-critical tasks to incentivize correct reasoning steps, not just final answers.</li>\n<li>Document governance policies: when CoT is stored, who accesses it, retention periods, and escalation protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The bigger shift</h2>\n<p>This work signals a broader evolution in how we think about AI safety. Instead of treating models as black boxes evaluated only on outputs, the focus shifts to making internal processes observable and steerable. If reasoning traces are legible and faithful, they become a control surface—a way to intervene before bad outcomes materialize.</p>\n\n<p>That's a powerful idea, but only if the traces actually reflect what the model is doing. OpenAI's framework gives us a systematic way to check.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/evaluating-chain-of-thought-monitorability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open AI Blog</a>.</p>"

      "content": "<p>There’s a point where a new tool stops feeling like a novelty and starts feeling like infrastructure. That’s where Google for Education seems to be heading with Gemini: not “an extra app,” but a layer that sits inside the workflows teachers and students already use.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s exactly why it’s worth thinking about it in secondary school. When AI is everywhere, the interesting question isn’t “can it help?” but <em>what kind of thinking does it quietly replace</em> — and what kind of thinking it can amplify if we’re intentional.</p>\n\n<h2>The promise: leverage, not magic</h2>\n<p>On paper, the use cases are obvious. Teachers are overloaded, students need feedback loops, and secondary school is full of bottlenecks where motivation dies: the blank page, the first draft, the fear of being wrong.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For teachers, Gemini-style tools can draft lesson plans, generate quiz questions, and create differentiated materials faster than a human can do from scratch.</li>\n<li>For students, the same tools can act like a tutor that never gets tired: re-explaining a concept, giving examples, generating practice questions, or helping structure an argument.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But the real promise isn’t that AI will “teach.” It’s that it can reduce friction enough that teachers spend more time on the parts of teaching that are <em>irreducibly human</em>: noticing misunderstanding, building trust, designing meaningful tasks, and helping students form an identity as learners.</p>\n\n<h2>The first deep challenge: motivation vs. outsourcing</h2>\n<p>Secondary school is the stage where students learn what “work” means. They also learn shortcuts. AI makes the best shortcut in history: instant coherence, instant structure, instant confidence.</p>\n\n<p>That creates a new kind of risk: not cheating as a moral failure, but <em>outsourcing as a habit</em>. If students repeatedly skip the painful early phase of thinking — the messy, uncertain, half-formed draft — they can end up with polished text and shallow understanding.</p>\n\n<p>This is the uncomfortable part: the more helpful the tool becomes, the more the curriculum has to shift from “produce an artifact” to “show the process.” Otherwise, assessment quietly becomes a contest of who can delegate best.</p>\n\n<h2>The second deep challenge: epistemic trust</h2>\n<p>In a classroom, authority is usually visible: textbooks, teachers, sources, citations. With AI, authority becomes conversational. It sounds confident, it speaks fluently, it rarely says “I don’t know.”</p>\n\n<p>So a student doesn’t just learn content — they learn a new relationship with knowledge itself. If an answer can be generated instantly, what becomes valuable is not recall, but the ability to judge: to cross-check, to detect weak reasoning, to separate “plausible” from “true.”</p>\n\n<p>AI literacy in secondary school can’t just be about prompt tips. It has to include a culture of verification: students learning to treat AI output as a <em>draft hypothesis</em>, not a fact.</p>\n\n<h2>What changes for teachers</h2>\n<p>Teacher workload is a real, practical reason to care about this. If AI can shrink the time spent on routine prep and repetitive feedback, that’s not a gimmick — it’s a structural improvement.</p>\n\n<p>But teachers also become designers of constraints. The job shifts from “explain and assign” toward “design tasks where AI use is visible, bounded, and educational.”</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ask for students’ decision logs: why they accepted or rejected suggestions.</li>\n<li>Use oral checks and micro-vivas for authenticity.</li>\n<li>Grade the quality of sources, assumptions, and argument structure — not just the final polish.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words: the teacher becomes less of a content broadcaster, more of a thinking coach.</p>\n\n <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/classroom-ai-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gemini in Classroom: No-cost AI tools that amplify teaching</a>.</p>"

In their framing, the goal is <em>no hallucinations</em>—because the system doesn’t return an answer unless it can be verified.</p><h2>From probability to proof</h2><p>The key shift is to treat verification as part of the computation, not as something humans do afterward. Axiomatic AI highlights using formal proof tools (notably Lean 4) to check logical soundness and mathematical rigor. That means mathematics isn’t “explained” in natural language; it’s expressed in a formal system that a computer can check.</p><p>This matters because a lot of scientific and engineering failures are not dramatic conceptual mistakes—they’re subtle errors that propagate: a wrong assumption, a missing constraint, a sign mistake, an approximation silently applied outside its regime. The whole point of a theorem prover is to make those failures loud.</p><h2>Physics as a guardrail</h2><p>Another part of the stack is grounding in physics-based models (their examples mention fundamental equations like Maxwell’s and Schrödinger’s) so predictions respect physical laws and can be validated against known solutions. The idea is simple: if a model is going to claim something about the physical world, it should be constrained by the structure of the physical world.</p><p>It’s less “generate an answer” and more “compute within a framework where breaking the laws of physics is not allowed.”</p><h2>Specialized agents, formal interfaces</h2><p>Axiomatic AI also describes specialized agents for different domains (math, physics, engineering) that communicate through formal interfaces—e.g., a math agent verifies equations before a physics agent runs a simulation. That’s an underrated systems idea: modular reasoning is only useful if the modules can’t lie to each other. Formal interfaces are how you get that.</p><p>In other words, “agentic” isn’t the headline here; <em>verifiable coordination</em> is.</p><h2>Measurement as a first-class output</h2><p>What really completes the picture is that they’re not only talking about proofs. They also talk about experimental control: integrating AI with hardware workflows (via CloudLab and their AX platform), using adaptive experimentation and Bayesian optimization to explore parameter spaces efficiently, and logging measurement conditions for reproducibility.</p><p>This is where “trustworthy AI” stops being abstract. If the system can suggest an experiment, run it, collect data, and record every knob it touched, the result becomes something you can reproduce, not just something you can screenshot.</p><h2>AX Verified Research and provenance</h2><p>Finally, AX Verified Research™ is basically an opinionated answer to the reproducibility crisis: track every result through knowledge graphs that capture data lineage, experimental conditions, and verification status. Their examples mention Neo4j to represent relationships between datasets, analyses, and publications, and to query which artifacts contributed to a given result.</p><p>This is the part that feels most “infrastructure”: not just correctness, but traceability.

      "content": "<p>Proof assistants have a reputation for being powerful but slow: the kind of thing you reach for when you want absolute certainty, and you’re willing to pay for it in time and friction. Terence Tao’s recent experiment is interesting because it attacks that tradeoff directly, aiming for a workflow where “formal-ish” verification is fast enough to be used as part of everyday problem solving, not just as a final archival step.</p><h2>A proof assistant that feels like a REPL</h2><p>Tao describes iterating from a proof-of-concept verifier into a more flexible, extensible proof assistant that deliberately mimics Lean in key ways, while being implemented in Python and powered by SymPy. The interaction model is intentionally simple: run Python in interactive mode, load an exercise, and drive the proof forward by applying tactics to the current proof state.</p><p>The examples make the point quickly. A goal is presented as a structured state (variables, hypotheses, and a target), and a single tactic like <code>Linarith()</code> can close a linear arithmetic goal, with an optional verbose mode that exposes the underlying feasibility check. It’s the same idea as modern theorem provers: humans provide high-level moves, the system does the tedious bookkeeping.</p><h2>Why this matters: the “boring” middle of proofs</h2><p>What makes this direction compelling is not that it replaces full formalization. It’s that it tries to cover the annoying middle ground: proofs that are conceptually straightforward but algebraically messy, where most human error hides. Tao explicitly leans toward semi-automated interactive proofs, where the user provides tactics and the tool pushes calculations through until the goal is discharged.</p><p>This is also why the tool’s focus on estimates is a good litmus test. Real analysis and asymptotics are full of manipulations that are easy to get wrong in small ways, and expensive to formalize end-to-end in a fully verified foundation. A lightweight assistant that can reliably certify these steps could be a practical bridge between pen-and-paper reasoning and fully formal proof libraries.</p><h2>Asymptotics, SymPy, and a pragmatic foundation</h2><p>The post gets especially fun when it moves from propositional/linear reasoning into asymptotic estimates. Tao sketches an approach where orders of magnitude (like <code>Theta(X)</code>) are represented in a way that plays nicely with SymPy’s symbolic machinery, and then verified via a log-linear arithmetic solver. In other words: take a domain where humans often hand-wave, and build tactics that turn the hand-waving into checkable structure.</p><p>There’s an important honesty here too. Tao notes the tool is not designed to be fully formally sound—Python and SymPy are not certified kernels—so the promise is not “trusted down to axioms.” The promise is closer to: get something that works, build a corpus of tactic-driven proofs, and eventually translate or export certificates into a fully verified system (he mentions Lean as a target direction) once the workflow is stable enough to justify the cost.</p><h2>The bigger picture</h2><p>One way to read this is as a bet on proof tooling evolving like developer tooling. A strict, verified kernel is like a compiler backend; a flexible, interactive layer is like the frontend that makes humans productive. If proof assistants are going to matter outside of niche communities, they need to feel less like writing a second proof and more like debugging: iterative, inspectable, and fast enough that you actually use it.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/05/09/a-tool-to-verify-estimates-ii-a-flexible-proof-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terence Tao — “A tool to verify estimates, II: a flexible proof assistant”</a>.</p>"

But there’s an irony in how it’s usually built: the agent learns through experience, while the learning rule itself is still mostly handcrafted by humans. A new Nature paper argues that this split is becoming unnecessary — and demonstrates a system that can <em>discover</em> a high-performing RL update rule from experience at scale.</p><p>The headline result is bold but easy to appreciate: the discovered rule (called <strong>DiscoRL</strong>) outperformed existing learning rules on the classic Atari benchmark, and then held up well on other challenging benchmarks that weren’t part of the discovery process. The deeper point is the direction of travel: if learning rules can be learned, algorithm design starts to look less like artisanal engineering and more like something that can compound with compute and diverse experience.</p><h2>The idea in plain terms</h2><p>Most RL algorithms differ in how they update an agent’s policy and predictions after it takes actions and receives rewards. In this work, instead of choosing that update rule upfront, the researchers represent the rule as a trainable “meta-network” that outputs targets the agent should move toward — effectively learning <em>how</em> the agent should update itself.</p><p>They then run a population of agents across many environments, and continuously improve the meta-network so that the agents trained under it achieve higher returns. Over time, this process produces a learning rule that is competitive with, and in some cases better than, the manually designed rules the field has relied on.</p><h2>Why this matters</h2><p>If this approach scales, it changes the bottleneck. Instead of relying on slow human iteration to invent new update rules, you can search a much larger space of possible algorithms using experience and meta-optimization — and let the resulting rule generalize beyond the environments it was discovered on.</p><p>The paper also makes a practical point: the discovered rule improves as discovery uses more diverse and complex environments, which hints at an “algorithm scaling law” style dynamic — better rules as a function of experience diversity, not just model size. That’s a big deal for anyone thinking about general-purpose agents.</p><h2>What stood out (without the math)</h2><p>A few pieces are worth calling out even without diving into technical details. First, the authors report that DiscoRL surpassed prior approaches on Atari in their setup, and that a variant discovered on a larger and more diverse environment set improved performance on multiple other benchmarks.</p><p>Second, their analysis suggests the learned rule develops its own useful internal predictions that don’t map cleanly onto standard RL concepts like “value functions,” and that these learned predictions end up informing the policy update rather than staying as a side quest. In other words: it’s not just rediscovering the same tricks with different knobs.</p><h2>The bigger takeaway</h2><p>This is a glimpse of a future where AI systems don’t just learn tasks — they also learn the learning machinery that makes them effective. That doesn’t mean research becomes automatic, but it does suggest progress may shift from “invent a new rule” to “design a discovery process that reliably produces strong rules.”</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09761-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nature</a>.</p>"

It fails because modern work is already fragmented: too many tabs, too many apps, too many interruptions, too many tiny handoffs that drain attention. <em>Perplexity at Work</em> is interesting because it treats AI as a workflow design problem, not a “prompting” problem.</p><p>The guide frames productive work as a progression in three layers: first you reclaim focus, then you scale your capabilities, and finally you convert that leverage into measurable results. The point is not to add another tool to manage, but to remove the friction that keeps you reacting all day instead of building anything substantial.</p><h2>Block distractions</h2><p>The foundational move is getting your attention back. The guide argues that the biggest productivity win comes from eliminating the admin overhead and context switching that constantly pulls you out of deep work. That’s where Perplexity’s workflow concept shows up: instead of bouncing between email, docs, calendar, research tabs, and internal tools, you delegate the repetitive glue tasks to AI.</p><p>Two practical ideas stood out:</p><ul><li>Use an AI assistant as an “attention shield”: summarize, triage, and surface what actually needs action.</li><li>Collapse multi-step workflows into a single prompt so you don’t pay the mental tax of switching tools and re-orienting.</li></ul><h2>Scale yourself</h2><p>Once focus returns, AI becomes a force multiplier. The guide’s core claim is that AI is best when your own talent stays in the lead: you bring the goals, taste, judgment, and constraints; AI brings speed, synthesis, and execution support. Instead of treating research and creation as separate phases, you can keep context connected and iterate faster.</p><p>Perplexity’s toolkit is presented as a unified platform (rather than scattered subscriptions), with components like an AI browser for research and actions, a research agent that reads broadly and cites sources, a creation studio for deliverables, and spaces to keep context organized across projects. The consistent theme: keep everything in one working environment so the context follows you.</p><h2>Get results</h2><p>The final layer is where most “AI productivity” talk gets vague, but this guide keeps it grounded: results are about outcomes other people recognize. That could be shipping faster, creating clearer deliverables, building better proposals, or showing impact in performance reviews. The idea is to channel the extra bandwidth into visible wins rather than just doing more busywork.</p><p>The guide encourages turning recurring work into automation primitives:</p><ul><li>Shortcuts for repeatable multi-step routines you trigger on demand.</li><li>Scheduled tasks for recurring research and reporting so the updates happen without you remembering to ask.</li></ul><p>That’s how AI stops being a clever assistant and starts functioning like a quiet operations layer.</p><h2>A better prompt habit</h2><p>A subtle but important point: prompting works best when you “think out loud” from the goal, not the keywords. Strong prompts describe the outcome, the workflow steps, and the format—so the assistant can execute like a capable teammate, not a search box.</p><p>In practice, that means asking for sequences (“first do X, then do Y, then produce Z”), and reusing those sequences as templates for the work you do every week.</p><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/enterprise/perplexity-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perplexity at Work</a>.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The big blocker for “agentic AI” hasn’t been intelligence. It’s been <em>reliable tool use</em>: how a model can safely read data, call APIs, and take actions without fragile glue code. Google’s announcement of official Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for Google services is a practical step toward that future, because it turns huge parts of the Google ecosystem into standardized, discoverable tools for agents.</p>\n\n<h2>MCP as the connector layer</h2>\n<p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) is described as a kind of “USB‑C for AI”: a standard way for models to connect to tools and data. The promise is less about smarter responses and more about completing multi-step tasks in the real world, where answers depend on current data, permissions, and operational constraints.</p>\n\n<p>The pain point Google calls out is that community MCP servers often require developers to install and manage local servers, or deploy open-source solutions themselves, which can be fragile and burdensome. Google’s move is to provide fully-managed, remote MCP servers so developers can point their agents (or standard MCP clients) at a consistent endpoint across Google and Google Cloud services.</p>\n\n<h2>What “official, managed MCP servers” changes</h2>\n<p>This is an automation upgrade disguised as plumbing. Instead of every team wiring their own set of connectors, Google is adding MCP as a unified layer on top of existing API infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, it means an agent can do the boring-but-critical parts of work more reliably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discover which tools exist (and what they do) through a standard interface.</li>\n<li>Use tools with structured inputs/outputs, instead of scraping text from CLIs.</li>\n<li>Operate with enterprise governance instead of “just trust the prompt.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>First services in scope</h2>\n<p>Google says MCP support is rolling out incrementally, starting with several high-impact services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Maps</strong>, via Maps Grounding Lite, to ground agents in trusted geospatial data (places, weather forecasts, routing, distance, travel time) and reduce hallucinations on location queries.</li>\n<li><strong>BigQuery</strong>, to let agents interpret schemas and run queries directly against enterprise data while keeping data in-place and governed (including access to features like forecasting).</li>\n<li><strong>Compute Engine</strong>, so agents can provision/resize infrastructure and handle day‑2 operations like adapting to changing workloads.</li>\n<li><strong>GKE</strong>, so agents can interact with Kubernetes APIs through a structured interface (less brittle parsing), enabling diagnosis, remediation, and cost optimization with guardrails.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Security and observability: where automation becomes usable</h2>\n<p>Automation only becomes deployable when it’s governable. Google highlights a “find trusted tools + control access” approach: Cloud API Registry and Apigee API Hub for discovery, Google Cloud IAM for access control, audit logging for observability, and Model Armor to help defend against agentic threats like indirect prompt injection.</p>\n\n<p>That’s important because it reframes what an “agent” is in an enterprise setting: not a clever model, but a controlled operator that leaves logs, follows permissions, and uses approved tools.</p>\n\n<h2>The brain shift: from asking to delegating</h2>\n<p>There’s a subtle cognitive shift that happens as tools become more reliable. When software is brittle, people keep tasks in their head and use tools as assistants. When tool use becomes robust and standardized, people start thinking in goals and delegations.</p>\n\n<p>MCP pushes in that direction: instead of “write me a query,” the task becomes “find the best retail location,” and the agent coordinates BigQuery analysis with Maps validation as one workflow. Google even sketches that exact example: an agent built with Agent Development Kit, backed by Gemini 3 Pro, forecasting revenue in BigQuery while cross-referencing Maps to scout nearby businesses and validate routes—all via managed MCP servers.</p>\n\n<p>This is the kind of change that compounds: not because any single model call is magical, but because the cost of connecting intelligence to action keeps dropping.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-official-mcp-support-for-google-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud announces official MCP support for Google services.</a>.</p>"

Most days the question isn’t “will it rain?” but “how wrong can the forecast be, and how costly is that error?” WeatherNext 2 is interesting because it doesn’t just chase a single best-guess forecast—it tries to map the space of plausible futures fast enough to be useful.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>What’s new in WeatherNext 2</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Google DeepMind and Google Research describe WeatherNext 2 as their most advanced global forecasting system, with the headline improvement being speed: it can generate forecasts up to 8× faster, and at up to 1-hour time resolution. Faster matters because it changes the practical bottleneck: instead of spending compute on one forecast, you can spend it on many scenarios.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>From one future to many</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The most provocative idea here is that a single deterministic forecast is often the wrong product. WeatherNext 2 can generate hundreds of possible weather outcomes from a single starting point, and it does it in under a minute per scenario on a single TPU (as described in the announcement). That’s the kind of capability that turns forecasting into decision support: “what’s the distribution of outcomes?” rather than “what’s the one answer?”\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      This is enabled by a modeling approach they call a Functional Generative Network (FGN), which injects “noise” into the model in a way intended to keep forecasts physically realistic and internally consistent. In plain terms: it’s not randomizing pixels; it’s sampling coherent worlds that still obey the constraints of weather systems.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Where it shows up (and why that matters)</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      WeatherNext technology is already being integrated into consumer-facing surfaces: Google says it has upgraded weather forecasts in Search, Gemini, Pixel Weather, and Google Maps Platform’s Weather API, with Google Maps integration planned as well. That’s a big deal because the value of better forecasts isn’t only scientific—it’s logistical, operational, and very human (commutes, travel plans, outdoor work, safety decisions).\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Opening it up to researchers</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Beyond products, WeatherNext 2 forecast data is being made available via Earth Engine and BigQuery, and Google also mentions an early access program on Vertex AI for custom inference. If this becomes accessible to more researchers and developers, it could accelerate downstream work: impact modeling, risk tools, and domain-specific forecasting layers built on top of a strong global prior.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The optimistic take is not “we’ve solved weather” (we haven’t), but that forecasting can become more trustworthy by being more explicit about uncertainty. In a chaotic system, honesty about the range of plausible outcomes is often the closest thing to reliability.\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>\n      Read more here: <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2/\">Google DeepMind Blog</a>\n    </p>\n  "

Instead of waiting for a magic bullet, the real progress is in using AI to make existing drugs more effective, trials more efficient, and diagnosis more equitable. Two recent examples capture this shift well.</p>\n\n<h2>AI that matches the right patients to the right drugs</h2>\n<p>A team at the University of Cambridge used an AI model to re-analyse a completed Alzheimer’s clinical trial that had failed in the overall population. The AI could predict, from early cognitive and imaging data, which patients were slow vs. rapid progressors toward full-blown Alzheimer’s.</p>\n\n<p>When they re-ran the trial data through this lens, they found something striking: the drug slowed cognitive decline by 46% in a subgroup of early-stage, slow-progressing patients with mild cognitive impairment. In the other group, it didn’t help.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway isn’t that this drug is a cure; it’s that AI can identify which patients are most likely to benefit. That means smaller, cheaper, faster trials, and a move toward precision medicine: matching the right drug to the right patient at the right time.</p>\n\n<h2>AI that finds undiagnosed cases in routine records</h2>\n<p>At UCLA, researchers built an AI tool that scans electronic health records to flag patients with undiagnosed Alzheimer’s. This addresses a huge gap: Alzheimer’s is significantly underdiagnosed, especially in underrepresented communities.</p>\n\n<p>Their model uses a semi-supervised approach that’s designed to be fair across different populations. It looks at patterns in diagnoses, age, and clinical notes, and can pick up subtle signals (like certain comorbidities) that might otherwise be missed.</p>\n\n<p>When validated, it showed much higher sensitivity across racial/ethnic groups than traditional models, and patients flagged as high-risk had higher genetic risk scores for Alzheimer’s. The goal isn’t to replace clinicians, but to help them prioritize who needs a deeper evaluation, especially as new disease-modifying treatments become available.</p>\n\n<h2>What this means for the Alzheimer’s fight</h2>\n<p>These examples show that near-term value of AI in Alzheimer’s isn’t about autonomous discovery, but about making the human-driven process smarter and more equitable.</p>\n\n<p>On the drug side, AI helps us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rescue promising drugs that failed in broad trials by finding responsive subgroups.</li>\n<li>Design smaller, more efficient trials that target the right patients.</li>\n<li>Move toward a precision medicine approach where treatment is tailored to individual progression risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On the care side, AI helps us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce diagnostic disparities by flagging high-risk patients in routine records.</li>\n<li>Enable earlier intervention, when lifestyle changes and new therapies can have the most impact.</li>\n<li>Scale detection in primary care without adding huge burdens on clinicians.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>AI won’t replace neurologists or drug developers, but it can make them much more effective.

It turns “does this help in a pilot?” into questions like: how do you ensure curriculum fit, consistency across regions, equitable access, and safe defaults for minors?

In theory that means preferences like dietary needs, favorite brands, or recurring topics become part of your default working setup, not something you restate manually.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Perplexity positions this differently from “training on your chats”: rather than treating your history as generic training data, it retrieves specific, relevant items from your memory store to answer the question you’re asking now. That’s a subtle but important distinction, because it makes memory feel like a user-controlled context layer rather than an opaque model update.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Privacy and control</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      A memory feature only works if it’s controllable. Perplexity emphasizes that memory can be turned off, and that memory and search history are automatically disabled in incognito mode (and prompts in incognito aren’t retained for memory). Data is encrypted, and there’s also an option to opt out of contributing to model improvement via data retention settings.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Context portability across models</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Another underrated benefit is “context portability”: being able to switch between different models without losing the personalization you’ve built up.

A recent study from Perplexity and Harvard researchers (released in December 2025) looks at real usage at scale and lands on a different picture: agents are increasingly used as cognitive partners, not just task-runners.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Cognitive work dominates</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The headline finding is striking: 57% of agent activity is cognitive work, split between Productivity &amp; Workflow (36%) and Learning &amp; Research (21%). In other words, a lot of people aren’t delegating “boring chores” as much as they’re delegating the messy middle of knowledge work: synthesizing information, navigating complexity, and turning scattered inputs into decisions.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      That maps well to real examples: a professional scanning case studies to extract patterns, or a student using an agent to navigate course material and make it more searchable and explainable. This is less about avoiding work and more about compressing the overhead that normally slows work down.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>How usage evolves over time</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Another useful insight is the progression. New users tend to start with low-stakes queries (travel ideas, trivia, entertainment), then shift toward higher-leverage uses once they see what’s possible—debugging code, summarizing reports, planning complex workflows, or structuring learning. The study describes this as a “pull” toward productivity: once people experience the leverage, they don’t fully go back.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Who sticks with agents</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Adoption isn’t uniform across professions. Digital technologists lead in volume (30% of queries), but knowledge-intensive fields like Marketing, Sales, Management, and Entrepreneurship show high “stickiness”—usage intensity that outpaces their adoption share once they integrate agents into daily workflow.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Context matters too: personal use accounts for 55% of queries, followed by professional (30%) and educational (16%). That mix is a reminder that “agent value” isn’t only about enterprise automation; it’s also about making everyday life and learning less cognitively expensive.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Why this matters</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The most interesting implication is that the near-term impact of agents might be about scaling cognition rather than replacing labor. If agents primarily accelerate synthesis, learning, and workflow setup, then the economic shift looks like “hybrid intelligence”: people + tools that extend attention, memory, and speed.\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>\n      Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/how-people-use-ai-agents\">Perplexity Blog</a>\n    </p>\n  "

What’s more useful is a stable mental model for collaborating with AI across tools and contexts.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Anthropic’s free AI Fluency course takes that route. Instead of teaching a bag of prompt hacks, it teaches a framework for working with AI effectively, efficiently, ethically, and safely, built around four core competencies (the “4Ds”). The course is developed in partnership with academic experts Joseph Feller and Rick Dakan.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>The 4Ds that make it practical</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The framework is simple enough to remember, but deep enough to apply repeatedly:\n    </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Delegation</strong>: Decide what should be done by you, what should be done by the model, and how to split tasks so you don’t outsource judgment by accident.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Description</strong>: Communicate intent and constraints clearly (context, audience, format, examples), so the model has something concrete to aim for.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Discernment</strong>: Evaluate outputs critically—both the final result and how the model got there—so you can catch errors, weak logic, and hidden assumptions.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Diligence</strong>: Use AI responsibly: be transparent where needed, stay accountable for what you publish, and consider downstream impacts.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Why this approach scales</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      What I like about this is that it’s tool-agnostic. The same habits apply whether the UI says Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, or something else—because the bottleneck isn’t the brand, it’s how well you set up the collaboration and how seriously you verify what comes back.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The course also leans into practice: interactive exercises, real-world projects, and a “Bad Prompt Makeover” style activity that forces you to notice why vague requests create vague results. There’s also a completion certificate, which is a nice forcing function if finishing courses usually drifts to the bottom of the todo list.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>What this is really about</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      AI is already reshaping workflows and job roles, but “better prompting” isn’t the endgame.

      "content": "\n    <p>\n      Reasoning models look like a big step forward: they generate a long chain of intermediate steps, then land on an answer. On math and coding benchmarks, that often works. But a question keeps bothering me: are these models actually getting better at reasoning, or are they just performing well on the kinds of problems we already know how to measure?\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      A NeurIPS 2025 paper called <em>The Illusion of Thinking</em> tackles that question using controllable puzzle environments. The key trick is that the puzzles let researchers dial up compositional complexity while keeping the underlying logic consistent, so you can study not only final accuracy, but also what happens inside the “thinking trace” as problems get harder.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Why problem complexity matters</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Most evaluations emphasize “did the model get the right answer?” on well-known benchmark distributions. The paper argues that this is incomplete (and sometimes misleading), because it doesn’t reveal how reasoning behavior changes when you systematically push difficulty beyond the familiar range.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      By controlling complexity directly, the authors can observe when a model’s apparent reasoning ability is robust and when it starts to behave more like pattern-matching under stress.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Key findings that stood out</h2>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        Accuracy can collapse once problems cross a certain complexity threshold, rather than degrading gradually.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        The scaling behavior is counter-intuitive: “reasoning effort” (often measured via how much the model writes/uses its thinking tokens) increases with complexity up to a point, then drops as tasks get even harder—even when token budget is still available.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Under matched inference compute, the paper describes three regimes:\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Low complexity: standard LLMs can outperform LRMs, suggesting extra “thinking” can add noise when tasks are easy.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Medium complexity: LRMs tend to do better, where structured intermediate reasoning actually helps.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            High complexity: both approaches can fail badly, highlighting a fundamental limitation rather than a tuning issue.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Exact computation remains a weak spot: the traces often look heuristic and inconsistent, which is a red flag for tasks that require algorithmic, deterministic steps.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h2>What this changes for evaluation</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The takeaway isn’t “reasoning models are useless.” It’s that we should be more careful about what we infer from benchmark wins. If accuracy collapses beyond a complexity boundary, then “more tokens” or “more compute at inference” isn’t a universal fix—and it becomes important to test models in settings where difficulty is controlled, not just sampled.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      It also reinforces something that’s easy to forget: a convincing chain-of-thought can be a UI artifact, not proof of stable internal computation. If the trace quality degrades or becomes inconsistent as complexity rises, the model may be narrating a path rather than executing one.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Why I’m paying attention</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      This line of work feels important because it forces a sharper definition of “reasoning.” If a model can only reason inside a comfort zone, then the real problem becomes: how do we build systems that fail predictably, expose uncertainty, and reliably handle tasks that demand exactness?\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>\n      Read more here: <a href=\"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking\">Apple ML Research</a>\n    </p>\n  "

Project Suncatcher is one of the boldest answers on the table—a research moonshot that explores whether serious machine learning compute could eventually live in orbit, powered directly by near-continuous sunlight.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Harnessing Solar Power for AI</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      The basic premise is straightforward: the Sun delivers an absurd amount of energy, and in the right orbit satellites can stay in sunlight for most (or nearly all) of their operational time. Project Suncatcher imagines compact constellations of solar-powered satellites, equipped with TPUs, designed to behave like a distributed “data center” in space while relying far less on terrestrial constraints like land and water.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>Overcoming Technical Challenges</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      Scaling compute in space isn’t about launching one big box—it’s about making many satellites act like one cohesive system. The project highlights several core challenges that need to be solved before this idea can move from speculative to practical:\n    </p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        High-bandwidth inter-satellite links: To run distributed ML workloads, the satellites would need data center-scale connectivity, targeting tens of terabits per second per link using approaches like dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) and spatial multiplexing.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Satellite formation control: Achieving those optical link budgets requires satellites flying in relatively tight and stable formations, with models that account for gravitational and orbital dynamics.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Radiation tolerance: Compute hardware in orbit must handle radiation exposure; the work discusses testing that suggests TPU designs can be more resilient than many people assume.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Economic viability: Even if the engineering works, launch costs have to fall far enough for orbital compute to compete with terrestrial buildouts, with projections pointing to improvements by the mid-2030s.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n\n    <p>\n      What makes this feel more than a thought experiment is the plan to validate pieces of the stack in orbit. A learning mission in partnership with Planet is planned to launch prototype satellites by early 2027 to test hardware and key assumptions in the real environment.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The reason Project Suncatcher is worth paying attention to is not because “AI data centers in space” is guaranteed to happen, but because it forces the right systems-level conversation: energy, networking, reliability, and the physics of scaling. If the next decade is about expanding compute responsibly, exploring extreme options like this helps map the boundary of what’s possible.\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>\n      Read more here: <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/\">Google Research Blog</a>\n    </p>\n  "

      "content": "\n            <p>\n                I’ve been following how AI labs are trying to move from “chatting about science” to actually supporting scientific work end-to-end. Anthropic’s announcement of <em>Claude for Life Sciences</em> is an interesting step in that direction: the pitch is not just a smarter model, but a model plus integrations and task-focused capabilities that can plug into the messy reality of R&amp;D.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                What caught my attention is the implied scope: from reading papers, to drafting protocols, to assisting with analysis, to helping with regulatory documentation. That’s ambitious, and it’s exactly where usefulness starts to matter more than vibes.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Enhanced Performance for Scientific Excellence</h2>\n            <p>\n                On the model side, the highlight is Claude Sonnet 4.5, positioned as their strongest model for life-sciences-flavored tasks. The announcement emphasizes improved performance on domain benchmarks (including Protocol QA and BixBench), with one concrete data point: Protocol QA at 0.83 versus a human baseline of 0.79.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                If those numbers hold up in practice, the practical implication is simple: fewer “looks plausible but wrong” moments when the task is procedural (lab protocols, compliance steps, structured experimental reasoning). In life sciences, that reliability gap is often the difference between “nice demo” and “actually usable.”\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Seamless Integration with Scientific Tools</h2>\n            <p>\n                The bigger story, to me, is the connector ecosystem. Instead of copying data back and forth between tools, Claude is meant to sit closer to where the work already happens. The announcement lists connectors for:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Benchling</strong> (experimental data and records).</li>\n                <li><strong>BioRender</strong> (figures and templates).</li>\n                <li><strong>PubMed</strong> (biomedical literature).</li>\n                <li><strong>Scholar Gateway</strong> (peer-reviewed sources).</li>\n                <li><strong>Synapse.org</strong> (collaborative data sharing/analysis).</li>\n                <li><strong>10x Genomics</strong> (natural-language interaction for single-cell workflows).</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n                Add the usual productivity integrations (Google Workspace, Microsoft Office), and the direction is clear: the model is being treated as a workflow layer, not just a text generator.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Empowering Researchers with Agent Skills</h2>\n            <p>\n                Another concept in the announcement is <em>Agent Skills</em>: packaged, repeatable task routines that Claude can run consistently. The initial focus mentioned is single-cell RNA sequencing quality control, borrowing best practices from the scverse ecosystem.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                This matters because “do the same analysis every time, the same way” is exactly what many labs need—especially for routine QC and reporting. If researchers can also create custom skills, the platform shifts from “one model for everyone” to “local automation primitives” tailored to a lab’s workflow.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Comprehensive Support Across the Research Lifecycle</h2>\n            <p>\n                The announcement frames Claude as helpful across the whole lifecycle:\n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Literature reviews &amp; hypothesis generation</strong>: summarizing biomedical papers and brainstorming directions.</li>\n                <li><strong>Protocol development</strong>: drafting study protocols and compliance docs (especially via Benchling).</li>\n                <li><strong>Data analysis</strong>: using Claude Code for processing genomic data and presenting results.</li>\n                <li><strong>Regulatory work</strong>: helping prepare and review submissions with fewer tedious iterations.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>\n                There’s also mention of a prompt library for common tasks. That’s a small detail, but it’s often what separates “power users can do magic” from “a normal team can adopt this without a month of trial-and-error.”\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>Partnerships and adoption</h2>\n            <p>\n                Anthropic also points to partnerships (Sanofi, Broad Institute, 10x Genomics) as a way to ground the product in real constraints. It’s hard to evaluate from the outside, but it signals they’re optimizing for actual deployment contexts rather than benchmark-only progress.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                They also mention an “AI for Science” program with free API credits for impactful projects, which is a sensible way to seed experimentation in academia and early-stage research settings.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2>What I take from this</h2>\n            <p>\n                The takeaway is not “Claude will discover drugs autonomously tomorrow.” It’s that the industry is converging on a practical stack: (1) stronger reasoning, (2) tighter tool/data integration, and (3) repeatable task skills. If this works, it reduces friction in the boring-but-critical parts of research—where time disappears.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                The open question is reliability under real lab conditions: edge cases, messy metadata, inconsistent protocols, and the human factors around validation. Still, the direction feels correct: make the model accountable to workflows, not just answers.\n            </p>\n\n            <p><strong>Contributor:</strong> Alessandro Linzi</p>\n\n<p>\n                Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-for-life-sciences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthropic — Claude for Life Sciences</a>\n            </p>\n                    "
