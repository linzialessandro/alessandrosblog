# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`docs/knowledge/glossary.md`** for domain terminology.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo OKF structure:

```
/
├── docs/knowledge/
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `docs/knowledge/glossary.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
